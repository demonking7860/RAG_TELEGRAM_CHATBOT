        "content": "Few other products have such stringent requirementsSociety seeks liberation from the dependence of oil and gravitates towards the battery as the ideal green solution for our energy needs. While this crusade is noble and right, the battery has not yet matured to take on this important responsibility. Pushing the boundaries of the battery reminds scientists of the many limitations this electrochemical power source presents. The battery is a feeble vessel that is slow to fill, holds limited energy, runs for a given time like a wind-up toy and has a defined life span of only a few hundred discharge-charge cycles before it becomes a nuisance.In many ways, the battery resembles human qualities. It needs recuperation from the daily travail with a long and restful charge, then delivers for a time and quits on its own terms. Some batteries need as much charging time as they deliver, and there are similarities with growing teenagers (the author raised five). It’s as if the battery has a mind of its own and decides when the time is right to deliver and when to stop walking.In an age where surprise developments flash before our eyes daily, the battery seems to make the exception of being late. Improvements made since the commercialization of lithium-ion in 1991 by Sony are pale compared to the vast advancements in microelectronics. Whereas the Moore’s Law doubled the number of transistors in an integrated circuit every two years, the capacity gain of Li-ion during the last two decades was only about eight percent per year. There will be further improvements but not without potential higher fragility, lower durability and shorter life.The battery consists of two electrodes that are isolated by a separator that is soaked in electrolyte and acts as catalyst much like the ham and cheese in our sandwiches. Progress is being made, however the lithium-air proposed in the 1970 with a potential specific energy resembling gasoline is delayed due to stability and air-purity issues as the battery breaths oxygen from the air. The promising lithium-metal introduced in the 1980s still grows dendrites, leading to possible violent reactions if an electrical short develops. The lithium sulfur may be closer but scientists must still resolve the short cycle life. The Redox-flow battery promises a solution for large battery systems by pumping fluids from external tanks through a membrane that resembles a battery. There is a glimmer of hope by coating the anode of Li-ion with graphene, a layer that is only one atom thick. This is said to quadruple the energy density and Elon Musk of Tesla is taking note. It must be uttered that experiments with graphene have been in the works for some time. Graphene also shows promise for other developments, including the supercapacitor and solar panels. Immerging batteries will take four years to commercialize, and there are no heavy lifters on the homerun.The Joint Centre for Energy Storage Research (JCESR) is more optimistic. The organization gathered the brightest minds from US national laboratories, universities and private enterprises to improve the battery. With a grant of $120 million from the US Department of Energy, JCESR wants to develop a battery that is “five times more powerful and five times cheaper in five years.” They call this the 5-5-5 Plan. “Can politicians create a better battery by throwing a ton of cash at it,” we ask? Battery development has been methodical and adding fertilizer might boost the growth for a time, but too much can poison a tree. Toyota is also in the race for a new battery. It will be called the “Sakichi battery” after Sakichi Toyoda, the inventor of Japan’s first power loom (Surname Toyoda is spelled with a d.) Sakichi is sometimes called the father of the Japanese industrial revolution. It is said than in 1925, Sakichi Toyoda promised a yet-to-be-claimed prize of 1 million yen for a storage battery that produces more energy than gasoline. To qualify for the price, the Sakichi battery must also be very durable and quick to charge.There is no shortage of battery breakthroughs but most fall silent. Some claims sound so promising that one questions the credibility. It’s no secret that researchers prefer publishing the positive attributes while keeping the negatives under wraps. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors, stated in June 2014 that he had not seen a battery breakthrough that is better than what Tesla deploys in their EVs. The reason for the low success is meeting a minimum of 10 basic requirements, which are: [1] high specific energy for long runtimes, [2] high specific power for load currents, [3] affordable cost, [4] long life, [5] high safety, [6] wide operating range, [7] no toxicity, [8] fast charging, [9] low self-discharge and [10] long shelf life.While most batteries for consumer products are lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) to attain a long runtime, industrial uses prefer the more rugged lithium manganese oxide (LMO) to achieve high load capabilities and long cycle life. Much effort is devoted to find a better battery for the electric vehicle (EV) and two philosophies have immerged, the Tesla Model and the BMW Model.The Tesla Model S uses lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) that delivers an ultra-high specific energy of 248Wh/kg. To protect the battery from over-loading and keeping it cool at highway speed, Tesla over-sizes the pack by a magnitude of 3–4 compared to the kWh rating of the BMW i3 and other EVs. At 85kWh, the battery in the S-85 is said to achieve a driving range of up to 424km (265 miles) between charges, but the pack is expensive and heavy and the extra weight increases energy consumption. The Tesla S-85 draws roughly 240 Watt/hours per km (360 Watt/hours per mile).The BMW i3, in comparison, uses the more conservative LMO that produces only 120Wh/kg and the 22kWh pack provides a driving range of 130–160km (80–100 miles). To compensate for the shorter driving range, the i3 also offers the REX, an optional gasoline engine that can be fitted on the back. The BMW i3 is lighter than the Tesla S-85 and has one of the lowest energy consumptions in the EV family. It only draws 160 Watts/hours per km (260 Watt/hours per mile).What remains unanswered is the longevity of the EV batteries. “Will they last as long as the car?” is the question because a battery replacement can cost as much as an economy car with combustion engine. All EV manufacturers must provide an eight-year warranty or a mileage limit. Tesla believes in their battery and offers unlimited mileage.The electric vehicle is not new. Most cars in the late 1800s and early 1900s ran on batteries. At the turn of the century, the car buyer had three choices of propulsion system to select from. They were electric, steam and internal combustion (ICE) engine, of which the ICE was the least common. Figure 1 shows Thomas Edison with his 1914 Detroit Electric model. Most electric cars ran on lead acid batteries and Mr. Edison felt that nickel-iron was superior and promoted his more expensive batteries.\nThe electric cars appealed to the upper class and the vehicles were finished with fancy interiors. Although higher in price than the steam and gasoline-powered vehicles, the wealthy chose the electric car for its quiet and comfortable ride over the vibration, smell and maintenance-prone gasoline-powered vehicles. Best of all, the electric car did not require gear-changing and manually engine-cranking, a task the upper class did not want to be seen doing. Since the only good roads were in town, the limited range of the EV was no problem and most of the driving was local commuting. With the invention of the starter engine in 1912, the market gravitated towards the ICE and the EV fell out of favor in the 1920s.SummaryConsumers are generally satisfied with the battery performance in their portable devices. Today’s battery technology also serves power backup reasonably well, but large lead acid systems are not well suited for systems needing continuous cycling.There are limitations as to how far the battery can go and the EV sets the threshold. It makes little sense to use batteries to power trains, ships and airplanes. Competing against the mighty oil with a net calorific value that is 100 times higher than the battery is a challenge. Conversely, petroleum cannot touch the battery that is clean, quiet, small, and has an immediate start-up with the flick of a switch.Batteries have a defined role and incremental improvements will secure more of what is so strongly entrenched in the seemingly endless flow of cheap fossil fuel. While oil is virtually free, society pays a price for burning it. Damage to the environmental and rising health issues have become more evident. But we cannot be so naïve as to think that batteries will solve our energy problem. The West is drunk with cheap oil and any deviation requires a change in our extravaganza, and few are willing.\nAbout the AuthorIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/safety-of-lithium-ion-batteries",
        "content": "Tesla Motors expects to consume two billion Li-ion cells by 2017. Both the Tesla Model S and Model X electric vehicles (EV) get their electrical energy from the 18650 cell, a format that also powers laptops and medical devices. The 18650 cell measures 18mm in diameter and is 65mm long. A cylindrical cell in a metallic case is durable and has a high specified energy (capacity), but cylinders are heavy and have a low packaging density in a cluster compared to the prismatic architecture and the pouch pack. A battery pack for a Tesla vehicle deploys over 7,000 cells, and to get the desired voltage and amperage, the cells are connected in series and parallel. Figures 1 illustrates the popular 18650 cell.\nAt 90kWh, the Tesla Model S has the largest battery in an electric car in terms of watt-hours; it also delivers the longest driving range between charges. In comparison, the Nissan Leaf comes with a 30kWh pack; the Ford Focus EV has 23kWh and the Chevy Volt 16kWh for corresponding shorter driving ranges. A 90kWh battery holds enough energy to provide a typical U.S. household with electrical needs for almost three days. But batteries must be charged and this draws heavily on the grid. They are also expensive; the EV battery alone carries the price tag of an economy car.Lithium ion batteries come in many variations and Tesla chose the high-energy nickel cobalt aluminum chemistry (NCA) for the S-Model. Made by Panasonic, the cell is rated at 3,100mAh, a specific energy that is slightly higher than most contenders. Other advantages of the NCA are high specific power for exuberant acceleration and long life. The negatives are high cost and a lower safety margin than other Li-ion systems. Figure 2 outlines six of the most important characteristics of a battery in a spider web.\nBatteries for the electric powertrain need high loading and a long life, and the NMC is another popular Li-ion system. NMC stands for nickel-manganese-cobalt and is also used in e-bikes, power tools and military and medical devices. The cathode may consist of one-third nickel, one-third manganese and one-third cobalt, but other combinations are also used to satisfy special requirements. These blends lower the raw material cost due to reduced cobalt content. Figure 3 demonstrates the characteristics of the NMC.\nAnother popular Li-ion system for electric powertrains is the Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4). Its strength lays in long life and superior safety, but it has a lower capacity than cobalt-based Li-ion systems. A further tradeoff is the lower nominal voltage of 3.3V/cell rather than the customary 3.6V/cell of other Li-ion systems. Figure 4 summarizes the attributes of Li-phosphate.\nLithium-ion has much improved. In 1994, the capacity of an 18650 cell was 1,100mAh at a manufacturing cost of over $US10 per cell. In 2001, the price dropped to $2 and the capacity rose to 1,900mAh. Today, high energy-dense 18650 cells deliver over 3,000mAh and the costs have gone down further. This, however, does not come without compromise. Newer cells are more delicate than older ones and this can affect the cycle count.A Swiss manufacturer of upscale e-bikes did a comparison on older and newer cells. They use the NMC 18650 cell from Panasonic and LG Chem. The early version rated at 2Ah still delivered 80% after the onboard Battery Management Systems (BMS) indicated 1000 cycles. Then came the 2.2Ah NMC and the capacity dropped to 70% after 1000 cycles. The modern 3Ah NMC used today drops to 60% after 1000 cycles. It should be noted that the end-capacity of the newer cells is still higher that the older ones; the 3Ah cell retains 1.8Ah after dropping 60% whereas the 2Ah cell has only 1.6Ah after a 20% capacity drop.EV batteries must carry an eight-year warranty. To achieve this, a new battery may only charge to 80% and discharge to 30%. As the battery loses capacity with age, many BMS gradually increases the charging bandwidth to maintain equal driving range. Once operating at full bandwidth, the battery gets stressed more, reflecting in accelerated performance drop and reduced driving range. Cold temperature causes the performance of all batteries to drop. Bitter cold also makes charging more difficult, especially with Li-ion, as charging is more delicate that discharging. The ability to use a battery at low temperature does not automatically permit charging under these same conditions. Carless charging at low temperatures can inflict permanent damage to the battery.Li-ion should not be charged below zero degree C (32°F). Some battery manufacturers permit charging down to -10°C (14°F) by reducing the charge current to a tenth of the battery rating, or 0.1C (see C-Rate), a charge that would take 12–15 hours on an empty battery. Charging too fast at low temperatures could lead to dendrite growth, reflecting in higher self-discharge and compromise safety.The battery stress is highest at 4.20V/cell when the battery reaches full charge. Keeping a lower voltage also protects the battery during cold-temperature charging and some BMS limit the voltage and current accordingly. Many EV batteries include a heating blanket to protect the battery when charging at cold temperature. Energy to heat the blanket is readily available from the grid.EV owners want ultra-fast charging and technology is available to do so. Although convenient, fast-charging is harmful to the battery. If at all possible, avoid charge times that are less than 90 minutes, or charge rates above 1C. The onboard BMS keeps record of stressful battery events and historic data can work against a warranty claim. This was the response of a large European EV manufacturer when the question of ultra-fast charging came up at a recent EV battery convention in London.Safety is a further concern, but this applies to all batteries. A one-in-200,000 failure triggered the recall of almost six million lithium-ion batteries in 2006. Sony, the manufacturer of these cells, said that on rare occasions microscopic metal particles may come into contact with other parts of the battery cell, leading to a short circuit than can cause venting with flame.Li-ion has improved and the failure rate has been reduced to one-in-10 million. This is reassuring, but the formula of one-in-10 million could cause 200 cells to fail in the batch of two billion that Tesla plans to consume. It is likely that the failure rate has gone down further but caution is in place when storing tons of batteries in one place. Fires with battery manufacturers and in warehoused storing batteries are common.Relatively little is known when Li-ion batteries are exposed to harsh environmental conditions. Internal shorts and rapid disassembly are of concern, an event that no safety circuit can stop once in progress. The fault occurs inside the cell and the battery must burn out.The Li-ion battery of Boeing 787 Dreamliner may have failed due to an electric short; the modified battery enclosed in a metal housing will provide a safeguard should a short recur. All batteries are subject to failure and there is also a reported incident where the battery circuit breaker of a Boeing 777 had to be pulled because of an overheating NiCd battery. In the early 1970s, the National Transportation Safety Board reported several battery incidents per year involving the then new nickel-cadmium ship-board battery on airplanes. Improvements eventually made NiCd safe; this will also happen with Li-ion.Transporting batteries by air remains a concern. There are regulations as to how much metallic (or equivalent) lithium can be included in an air shipment. Some content may go unregistered and the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority found with reasonable certainty that the fire aboard the UPS 747-400 freighter was caused by a lithium battery. The aircraft went down on September 2010 in the Dubai desert about an hour into its flight to Cologne, Germany.New air cargo containers are being tested with materials that can withstand intense fires for up to four hours, enabling an emergency landing on most flights. The fire-resistant panels of these air cargo containers consist of fibre-reinforced plastic composite that snuffs fire by depriving it of oxygen.A fire is easier to put out in the cabin than in the cargo bay and since January 2008 people can no longer pack spare lithium batteries in checked baggage. (See Li-ion travel restrictions.) Airlines allow them as carry-on where fire extinguishers are available. A coffee pot served as an extinguishing device of a flaming laptop battery in one incident. Travelers are reminded of how many batteries can be carried on board in portable devices and as spares. This also includes primary lithium batteries and the maximum weights of lithium (or equivalent) are:\nEffective 2016, lithium-based batteries can no longer be carried as cargo in a passenger aircraft. In addition, Li-ion in cargo must have a state-of-charge of 30 percent. All packages must bear the Cargo Aircraft Only label in addition to other required marks and labels. This limitation does not affect lithium ion batteries packed with or contained in equipment.While Li-ion is being scrutinized for safety, other chemistries also exhibit problems. Nickel- and lead-based batteries cause fires too, and some are being recalled. Reasons for failure are defective separators resulting from aging, rough handling, excessive vibration and high-temperature.Examining 113 recorded incidents of transporting batteries by air over a 19-years period reveals that most failures occurred due to inappropriate packaging or handling. Damaged battery packs and electrical shorts due to careless packaging were the main culprits. Most incidents happened at airports or in cargo hubs. Problem batteries include primary lithium that contains lithium-metal, as well as lead, nickel and alkaline systems, and not just lithium-ion, as is perceived. Modern consumer products have very few failures involving Li-ion batteries today.\nBatteries International Magazine, Issue 90, Winter 2013/14Portable Rechargeable Battery Association (PRBA)Boston Consulting Group (BCG)E-One Moli Energy (Canada) LtdNational Transportation Safety BoardUnited Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation AuthorityBatteries in a Portable World, Cadex Electronics: Isidor Buchmann\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "title": "Is the Electric Car Mature?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/is-the-electric-car-mature",
        "content": "Cars with electric drive trains have been around for more than 100 years. At the turn of the century in 1900, a car buyer had three choices of propulsion systems: electric, steam and internal combustion engine, of which the IC engine was the least common. The electric cars appealed to the upper class and the vehicles were finished with fancy interiors and expensive materials. Although higher in price than the steam and gasoline-powered vehicles, the wealthy chose the electric car for their quiet and comfortable ride over the vibration, smell and high maintenance of the gasoline-powered counterpart. Best of all, EV (electric vehicles) did not require changing gears, the most dreaded part in driving a gasoline car then. Nor did the EV need manual cranking to start the motor, a task the upper class did not want to be seen doing. Since the only good roads were in town, the limited range of the EV was no problem and most of the driving was local commuting. The production of the EV peaked in 1912 and continued until the 1920s. The battery choice was lead acid, and for an up-price the buyer could fit the Detroit Electric with nickel-iron (NiFe), a battery Thomas Edison promoted. NiFe has a cell voltage of 1.2V, was robust and durable even when over-charged and fully discharged. Being a good businessman, Edison advocated NiFe over lead acid but the popularity for this battery began to decline after a fire destroyed the Edison factory and laboratory in 1914. NiFe provided only a slightly better energy density to lead acid and was expensive to manufacture. In addition, the battery performed poorly at low temperature and the self-discharge was 20-40 percent a month, considerably higher than lead acid. Detroit Electric, one of the most popular EVs then, were said to get 130km (80 miles) between battery charges. Its top speed was 32km (20 miles) per hour, a pace considered adequate for driving. Physicians and women were the main buyers. Thomas Edison, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and Clara Ford, the wife of Henry Ford, drove Detroit Electrics. Figure 1 shows Thomas Edison with his 1914 Detroit Electric model. Batteries play an important role in electric powertrains and the price per kilo-watt-hour varies according to battery type. Table 1 lists typical batteries for mobility, and at $160 per kWh the starter battery is most economical, followed by the forklift battery. Newer technologies are more expensive and this is due to costly raw materials, complex manufacturing procedures, and electronic safety and management systems. Higher volume production will only moderate the price marginally.\nFigure 1: Thomas Edison with a 1914 Detroit Electric, model 47.\nThomas Edison felt that nickel-iron was superior to lead acid for the EVs and promoted it at an added cost.\n(Courtesy of the National Museum of American History).\nCost cutting as part of mass-production by Henry Ford and the invention of the starter motor in 1912 moved the preference of car buyers to gasoline-powered vehicles. By the 1920s, intercity roads required long-range vehicles and the discovery of Texas crude oil made gasoline affordable to the general public. The EV became a thing of the past until the early 1990s when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) began pushing for more fuel-efficient and lower emission vehicles and mandated the zero-emission car. It was the CARB zero-emission policy that prompted General Motors to produce the EV1. Available for lease between 1996-1999, this early electric vehicle run on a 18kWh lead acid battery that was later replaced with a 26kWh NiMH pack. Although the NiMH battery gave an impressive driving range of 260 km (160 miles), the EV1 was not without problems. Manufacturing rose to three times the cost of a regular gasoline-powered car and in 2001 politicians changed the CARB requirements, which prompted General Motors to withdraw the EV1 to the dismay of many owners. The 2006 documentary film “Who Killed the Electric Car?” gives a mixed impression of government-induced programs for cleaner transportation. To match the convenience of an IC powered vehicle, the EV needs a battery capable of delivering 25-40kWh. This is twice the battery size of a PHEV and ten-times that of the HEV. The electrochemical battery is not the only added expense; the power electronics to manage the battery make up a large part of the vehicle cost. An EV without a battery is roughly the same cost as a traditional gasoline-powered car. Figure 2 shows the battery of the Nissan Leaf removed and as part of the installation.\n24kWh lithium-ion battery with a driving range of 160 km (100 miles) of city driving. The battery fits under the floor and seats of the car. (Courtesy of Nissan Motors) Another concern with the EV is it’s driving range, especially in cold and hot weather. Designed to go 160 km (100 miles) on a charge, a BMW electric Mini traveled about half that distance in cold weather. Beside the added energy drawn to heat the cabin, battery performance drops in cold temperatures. To conserve energy, EV drivers should use the heat and air conditioning systems sparingly and drive in a reasonable manner. It will take a day to fully charge the electric Mini on a regular 115AC outlet. High-power outlets can reduce the charge time to 3-5 hours, and public fill-up stations can charge a battery in two hours. The electrical outlet, not the battery, governs charge times. Charging a 40kWh battery in six minutes, as some battery manufacturers might claim, would require 400kW of power. An ordinary 115VAC electrical outlet provides only 1.5kW and a 230VAC, 40A kitchen stove outlet delivers 9kW. Car manufacturer Tesla Motors focuses on building EVs that generate zero-emissions with very high performance. The Silicon Valley roadster boasts a zero to 96km (zero to 60 miles) acceleration time of 3.9 seconds. The 7000 Li-ion cells store 53kWh of electrical power and promise a driving range of 320km (200 miles). Liquid cooling prevents the pack from exceeding 35°C (95°F). To achieve a five-year warranty, Tesla charges the Li-ion cobalt cells to only 4.10V instead of 4.20V/cell, and electronics circuits inhibit charging in freezing temperatures. At $130,000, this car turns heads and becomes a discussion item, however, the $40,000 of a replacement battery could causes concern for long-term owners.Batteries for the electric powertrain currently cost between $1,000-1,200 per kWh. According to The Boston Consulting Group (BCG), relief is in sight. They claim that within the next decade the price of Li-ion will fall to $750 per kWh. Meanwhile, batteries for consumer electronics are only around US$250-400 per kWh. High volume, automated manufacturing, lower investments in safety and shorter calendar life makes this low price possible. BCG predicts that Li-ion batteries for the powertrain will eventually match these consumer prices, and the cost of a 15kWh battery will drop from $16,000 to about $6,000. The largest decrease in battery prices is expected to occur between now and 2020, with a more gradual decline thereafter. According to BCG, the anticipated calendar life of the battery will be 10-15 years.E-One Moli Energy, a manufacturer of lithium-ion cells for power tools and electric vehicles, says that the cost of Li-ion can be reduced to $400 per kWh in high volume but the peripheral electronics managing the battery will remain high and this added cost is know to double the price of a pack. Reductions are also possible here and E-One Moli Energy predicts that the electronics will only make up only 20 percent of the battery cost in five years. These forecasts are speculative and other analysts express concern that the carmakers may not be able to achieve the long-term cost target without a major breakthrough in battery technology. They say that the current battery cost is 3-5 times too high to appeal the consumer market. Driving on electricity is cheaper and cleaner than burning gasoline, but at today’s low fuel prices, uncertainty regarding the service life of the battery, along with unknown abuse tolerances and high replacement costs will lower the incentive for buyers to switch from a proven concept to an electric vehicle. Technology Roadmaps Electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (EV/PHEV) says that if a driver wants a 500 km range between fill-ups achievable with an IC powered car, the battery would need a capacity of 75 kWh. At an estimated $400 price tag per kWh, such a battery would cost over $30,000 and weigh nearly a ton. Figure 3 illustrates typical battery sizes used in cars with different powertrains.\nRoadmap compares the energy consumption and cost of gasoline versus electric propulsion as follows: The EV requires 150-200Wh per km, and at a consumption rate of 200Wh/km, and an electricity price of $0.15 per kWh, the fuel cost to drive an EV translates to $0.03 per km. We compare this figure with $0.06 per km for an equal-size gasoline-powered car and $0.05 per km for diesel. This price does excludes equipment costs, service and eventual replacement of the battery and engine.The EV market attracts innovative companies to develop a better battery and many are taking advantage of generous government incentives offered, but there is a danger. For the sake of optimal energy density, some start-up companies are experimenting with aggressive design concepts using volatile chemicals that compromise safety. They push the envelope by announcing impressive advancements, emphasize only the pros and squelch the cons. Such behavior will get media attention and entice venture capitalists to invest, but hype does little in finding a lasting solution to improve existing battery technologies. The battery will determine the success of the EV and until major improvements have been achieved in terms of higher energy density, longer service life and lower cost, the electric powertrain will be limited to a small niche market. While governments are giving large contributions in the hope to improve current battery technologies, we must realize that the electrochemical battery has limitations. This was made evident when motorists tested eight current and future models with electric powertrains and attained driving ranges that were one third less than estimated. Table 4 lists a rundown.

The travel distance is less than advertised; battery aging will shorten the range further. The environmental benefit of driving an EV will be minimal unless renewable resources provide the electricity to charge the batteries. Burning coal and fossil fuel to generate electricity simply shifts the pollution out of congested cities to the countryside. In the USA, electricity comes from burning 50 percent coal, 20 percent natural gas, 20 percent nuclear, 8 percent hydro and 2 percent solar and wind. One of the advantages of the EV is charging at night when the power grid has extra capacity.Going electric may create another dilemma, which begs the question, “In the absence of fuel tax, who will pay for the maintenance and new construction of highways?” Roads cost governments billions to build and repair, and EV drivers will be entitled to use them for free, a gift that needs to be compensated with higher taxes. This poses an unfair burden for those taking public transportation as they pay double: tax for highways and the fair for bus or train. Raising road tolls may be an alternative. The high cost of the EV against the lure of cheap and readily available fossil fuel will make the transition to a cleaner way of living more difficult. Government subsidies may be needed to make “green” cars affordable to the masses. Many argue that this handout of public money is unfair and suggest that the tax dollars should go to building more efficient public transportation systems. The goal of governments should be to remove cars from the roads by offering other modes of transportation. Commuter trains are one of the most efficient alternatives in moving people comfortably and fast. Changing the focus away from cars would, for the first time in 100 years, hand our cities back to the people who are the rightful owners. Such a change in direction would make cities more enjoyable and future generations would thank their forefathers for prudent planning. It’s interesting to note that some of the nicest cities were built before the invention of the car. During this time, designers had the movement of people in mind and this was done out of necessity rather than foresight. Most of these desirable cities are in Europe, and North America appears to be trailing behind.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Conventional battery test methods measure the stored energy through a full discharge. This procedure is time-consuming and stresses the battery. There is a move towards methods that take only seconds instead of hours; however, rapid testing provides only estimated state-of-health values, and the accuracies vary according to the method used. Public safety, medical and defense organizations still depend on tests involving periodic full discharge/charge cycles.\nBattery analyzers became popular in the 1980s and 1990s to restore nickel-cadmium batteries affected by “memory,” as well as to prolong battery life as part of maintenance. The Cadex C7000 Series serves the industry well and set new standards for what a battery analyzer could do. These workhorses accommodate lead-, nickel- and lithium-based batteries, and operate stand-alone or with a PC. Figure 1 illustrates a C7400 battery analyzer servicing a variety of batteries in configured adapters that set the analyzer to the correct setting. Each of the four independent stations allows unique service programs.\nFigure 1:Cadex C7400 battery analyzer\nTwo- and four-station analyzers service batteries from 1.2 to 15V, programmable up to 4A per station. The extended version goes to 36V and 6A charge and discharge currents. The service programs include QuickSort™ for rapid-testof Li-ion batteries.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nConnecting various shapes and forms of batteries has always been a challenge, and technicians have invented unique contraptions with springs and levers so complicated that only the inventor dares to touch. There is no simple way to connect batteries, especially when dealing with small packs that have tiny surface contacts.\nCadex solved the battery interface challenge with custom adapters for common batteries and universal adapters for specialty packs. The custom adapters are easiest to use; they are specially designed and the batteries go in only one way. The adapters are smart and are able to hold configuration codes for up to 10 different battery types. This allows the servicing of batteries with identical footprints but different electrical values. The user can edit the parameters with the menu function on the analyzer or with the PC.\nThe universal adapters consist of user-programmable Smart Cables that accommodate virtually any battery type. With the proliferation of cellular batteries and the need for a quick and simple battery interchange, Cadex developed the RigidArm™(Figure 2). This adapter features spring-loaded arms that meet the battery contacts from the top down and apply correct pressure to the contacts. Lockable mechanisms allow quick and repetitive testing of same-type batteries. The retractable floor holds the battery in a vertical position, and magnetic guides keep the battery in place if laid horizontally. For added safety, a temperature sensor monitors the battery during the test.\nFigure 2: RigidArm™ for cellular batteries\nThe universal adapter simplifies the interface with small batteries. The adapter holds 10 of the most commonly used mAh ratings and is compatible with Cadex battery analyzers.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nAdvancements made in battery test equipment make it feasible to service the over four billion cellular batteries in global use at storefronts while the customer waits. Hooking up the battery still needs some skill, and once the contacts are established the service technician may need to enter the capacity in mAh and other battery specifications.\nMost cellular batteries have three or four contacts. The positive [+] terminal is normally at the outer edge and the negative [–] one is positioned towards the inside. The third contact is the thermistor measuring the battery temperature, and unless the battery adapter is specially made for the battery type, the thermistor is normally not hooked up for the test; a universal adapter often has its own temperature protection. The fourth contact, if available, may offer code identification for configuration. Figure 3 illustrates a typical contact positioning.\nFigure 3:Typical contacts on a cellular battery\nThe positive [+] is normally at the outer right and the negative [–] is on the inside. Most batteries have a thermistor; some also offer a code.\nReturned batteries are either discarded or shipped to service centers where they are tested and redistributed as Class B packs. Looking closer at the tonnage of these returned batteries reveals that nine out of 10 packs have no problem and can be serviced. Seeing an opportunity for business, large refurbishing centers have sprung up in the USA that test 400,000 batteries per month, with volumes anticipated to increase to one million per month.\nStorefront testing reduces waste, and the motto goes: “To the storefront and no further.” Battery analyzers featuring rapid-test programs are offered that give a clear assessment of a battery in a few seconds while the customer waits. Figure 4 illustrates a service concept for storefront testing while the customer waits. If the battery needs charging or has a genuine fault, an alternate pack is given from the pool of previously tested batteries.\nFigure 4:Storefront service\nBatteries are serviced while the customer waits. A faulty pack is replaced from the pool of previously serviced batteries. Storefront testing reduces handling, lessens disposal and improves customer satisfaction.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nOne of the difficulties of storefront testing has been the availability of suitable battery diagnostic equipment. The older units lacked accuracy in rapid testing, and had a predictive capacity that resembled a ticket in a Las Vegas lottery; many potential users hesitated to buy such equipment. QuickSort™ provides 90 percent accuracy across the population of cellular batteries. With a PC, some analyzers allow service reports to be printed, and the Internet enables a central manager to monitor the activity of each store. Figure 5 illustrates a battery analyzer designed for storefront use.\nFigure 5: Cadex C5100 analyzer for lithium-ion batteries\nThis analyzer rapid tests, charges and cycles batteries. The RigidArm™ adapter allows easy interface to cellular batteries; also accepts preprogrammed adapters. QuickSort™ tests batteries in 30 seconds.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nA battery analyzer assures that fleet batteries meet the minimum performance standards. The device also helps to restore low performers, if such a service is possible with the battery types in question. In addition, a battery analyzer supervises the all-important function of a timely replacement at the end of a productive life. Manufacturers of portable equipment support battery maintenance because well-performing batteries reflect positively on the equipment, a win-win situation for both manufacturer and user.\nMany battery analyzers come with PC application software. With BatteryShop™(by Cadex), for example, the PC becomes the command center and all functions are processed through the keyboard, as well as other input devices. Clicking the mouse on any of the 2,000 batteries listed in the database configures the analyzer to the correct setting, eliminating the need for further programming. The user has the liberty to add, remove and edit the batteries listed should the specification change.\nLabeling each fleet battery with a permanent ID number simplifies logistics and traceability. A printer connected to PC BatteryShop™ generates these labels in bar code format. The user simply scans the label, which in turn configures the analyzer and retrieves the performance history for review. Besides capacity readings and service dates, purchasing date, vendor information and pricing can also be entered. Figure 6 illustrates the battery scan, service and data examination.\nFigure 6:Fleet battery management\nLabeling each battery with a unique number simplifies battery service. Swiping the barcode label reveals the history of the battery.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nAnother tracking method for fleet batteries is attaching a removable label that shows the battery information at a glance between services, as illustrated in Figure 7. The system is self-governing in that all batteries must regularly be serviced as part of quality control. This is made possible by providing a time period between the last service and the new date due. With this information on hand, the prudent battery user only picks a battery that has been serviced and meets this quality assurance (QA) test protocol. Setting up the maintenance system is simple and managing it requires only about 30 minutes per day.\nFigure 7: Sample of removable battery label\nThe label shows battery information at a glance and includes name of organization for traceability, capacity in percent, as well as past and future service dates.\nSetting up a battery maintenance system requires a battery analyzer that is capable of printing battery stick-on labels. The analyzer should also offer a program that automatically restores nickel-based batteries if the set capacity threshold cannot be met. Cadex analyzers meet these requirements and go one step further by offering adjustable capacity target settings to select the minimum performance criteria for the given operation.\nMost fleet operations use 80 percent as their battery pass/fail criterion. Increasing the threshold to 85 percent tightens the performance tolerance but passes fewer batteries; lowering the settings extends service life but offers less stringent performance standards. When choosing the setting, the organization must ensure that the lowest-level battery in the fleet is able to fulfill its assigned duty. Figures 8, 9 and 10 illustrate the battery label system.\nRechargeable batteries do not die suddenly but gradually get weaker with time. A service every one to three months offers plenty of confidence that all batteries will meet the minimum required capacity and last through the shift with some energy to spare.\nFigure 8:Sorting batteries for servicing\nWhen taking a battery from the charger, the user checks the service date, and if expired the battery is placed in the “To be serviced” box.\nFigure 9:Servicing expired batteries\nThe analyzers service the batteries and recondition them if low in capacity (only nickel-based batteries receive recondition). Passing batteries are relabeled showing capacity and the next service date.\nFigure 10:Reinstating batteries\nThe failed batteries are removed from service and replaced with new packs. The new and serviced batteries go back into service by being charged.\nAll figures Courtesy of Cadex\nWhile battery analyzers are tools to service batteries; battery test systems provide multi-purpose test functions for research laboratories. Typical applications are life cycle testing and verifying cell balance in field imitation. Such tests can often be automated with a custom program. Load capture allows storing load signatures for playback simulations. Many battery test systems also control external load units and environmental chambers. Other uses of such systems are quality inspections and verifying warranty claims. Figure 11 illustrates a typical battery test system.\nFigure 11:Cadex C8000 Battery Test System\nFour independent channels provide up to 10A each and 36V. Maximum charge power is 400W, discharge is 320W. The discharge power can be enhanced with external load banks.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nThe alternate to a battery test system is a programmable power supply controlled by a computer. Such a platform offers flexibility but requires careful programming to prevent stress to the battery and possible damage or fire if an anomaly were to occur. A battery test system, such as the Cadex C8000, offers protected charge and discharge programs that identify a faulty battery and terminate a service safely. The system can be overridden to do destructive tests.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "NOTE: This article has been archived. Please read our new \"Can Batteries be Restored?\" for an updated version.\nSome rechargeable batteries can be restored through external means, such as applying a full discharge. There are, however, many defects that cannot be corrected. These include high internal resistance, elevated self-discharge, electrical short, dry-out, plate corrosion and general chemical breakdown.The performance loss of a battery occurs naturally as part of usage and aging; some is hastened by lack of maintenance, harsh field conditions and poor charging practices. This paper examines the cause of non-correctable battery problems and explores ways to minimize these breakdowns.\nAll batteries are affected by self-discharge. This is not a defect per se, although improper use enhances the condition. Self-discharge is asymptotical; the highest loss occurs right after charge, and then tapers off.Nickel-based batteries exhibit a relatively high self-discharge. At ambient temperature, a new nickel-cadmium loses about 10% of its capacity in the first 24 hours after charge. The self-discharge settles to about 10% per month afterwards. Higher temperature increases the self-discharge substantially. As a general guideline, the rate of self-discharge doubles with every 10°C (18°F) increase in temperature. The self-discharge of nickel-metal-hydride is about 30% higher than that of nickel-cadmium.The self-discharge increases after a nickel-based battery has been cycled for a few hundred times. The battery plates begin to swell and press more firmly against the separator. Metallic dendrites, which are the result of crystalline formation (memory), also increase the self-discharge by marring the separator. Discard a nickel-based battery if the self-discharge reaches 30% in 24 hoursThe self-discharge of the lithium-ion battery is 5% in the first 24 hours after charge, and then reduces to 1% to 2% per month thereafter. The safety circuit adds about 3%. High cycle count and aging have little effect on the self-discharge of lithium-based batteries. A lead-acid battery self-discharges at only 5% per month or 50% per year. Repeated deep cycling increases self-discharge. The percentage of self-discharge can be measured with a battery analyzer but the procedure takes several hours. Elevated internal battery resistance often reflects in higher internal battery resistance, a parameter that can be measured with an impedance meter or the OhmTest program of the Cadex battery analyzers.\nEven with modern manufacturing techniques, the cell capacities cannot be accurately predicted, especially with nickel-based cells. As part of manufacturing, each cell is measured and segregated into categories according to their inherent capacity levels. The high capacity 'A' cells are commonly sold for special applications at premium prices; the mid-range 'B' cells are used for commercial and industrial applications; and the low-end 'C' cells are sold at bargain prices. Cycling will not significantly improve the capacity of the low-end cells. When purchasing rechargeable batteries at a reduced price, the buyer should be prepared to accept lower capacity levels.The cells in a pack should be matched within +/- 2.5%. Tighter tolerances are required on batteries with high cell count, those delivering high load currents and packs operating at cold temperatures. If only slightly off, the cells in a new pack will adapt to each other after a few charge/discharge cycles. There is a correlation between well-balanced cells and battery longevity.Why is cell matching so important? A weak cell holds less capacity and is discharged more quickly than the strong one. This imbalance may cause cell reversal on the weak cell if discharged too low. On charge, the weak cell is ready first and goes into heat-generating overcharge while the stronger cell still accepts charge and remains cool. In both cases, the weak cell is at a disadvantage, making it even weaker and contributing to a more acute cell mismatch. Quality cells are more consistent in capacity and age more evenly than the lower quality counterparts. Manufacturers of high-end power tools choose high quality cells because of durability under heavy load and temperature extremes. The extra cost pays back on longer lasting packs.lithium-based cells are by nature closely matched when they come off the manufacturing line. Tight tolerances are important because all cells in a pack must reach the full-charge and end-of-discharge voltage thresholds at a unified time. A built-in protection circuit safeguards against cells that do not follow a normal voltage pattern.\nManufacturers are often unable to explain why some cells develop high electrical leakage or an electrical short while still relatively new. The suspected culprit is foreign particles that contaminate the cells during manufacturing. Another possible cause is rough spots on the plates that damage the separator. Better manufacturing processes have reduced the 'infant mortality' rate significantly.Cell reversal caused by deep discharging also contributes to shorted cells. This may occur if a nickel-based battery is being fully depleted under a heavy load. nickel-cadmium is designed with some reverse voltage protection. A high reverse current, however, will produce a permanent electrical short. Another contributor is marring of the separator through uncontrolled crystalline formation, also known as memory.Applying momentary high-current bursts in an attempt to repair shorted cells offers limited success. The short may temporarily evaporate but the damage to the separator material remains. The repaired cell often exhibits a high self-discharge and the short frequently returns. Replacing a shorted cell in an aging pack is not recommended unless the new cell is matched with the others in terms of voltage and capacity.\nAlthough sealed, the cells may lose some electrolyte during their life, especially if venting occurs due to excessive pressure during careless charging. Once venting has occurred, the spring-loaded vent seal on nickel-based cells may never properly close again, resulting in a build-up of white powder around the seal opening. The loss of electrolyte will eventually lower the battery capacity. Permeation, or loss of electrolyte in valve regulated lead-acid batteries (VRLA) is a recurring problem. Overcharging and operating at high temperatures are the causes. Replenishing lost liquid by adding water offers limited success. Although some capacity may be regained, the performance becomes unreliable. If correctly charged, lithium-ion cell should never generate gases and cause venting. But in spite of what is said, the lithium-based cells can build up internal pressure under certain conditions. Some cells include an electrical switch that disconnects the current flow if the cell pressure reaches a critical level. Other cells rupture a membrane to release the gases in a controlled way. lithium-ion-polymer in a pouch cell sometime grows to the shape of a small balloon because these cells do not include venting. Ballooning cell are known to damage the housing of the portable device.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Heat is a killer of all batteries, but high temperatures cannot always be avoided. This is the case with a battery inside a laptop, a starter battery under the hood of a car and stationary batteries in a tin shelter under the hot sun. As a guideline, each 8°C (15°F) rise in temperature cuts the life of a sealed lead acid battery in half. This means that a VRLA battery for stationary applications specified to last for 10 years at 25°C (77°F) would only live 5 years if continuously exposed to 33°C (92°F) and 30 months if kept at a constant desert temperature of 41°C (106°F). Once the battery is damaged by heat, the capacity cannot be restored.\nAccording to the 2010 BCI Failure Mode Study, starter batteries have become more heat-resistant. In the 2000 study, a rise in temperature of 7°C (12°F) affected battery life by roughly one year; in 2010 the heat tolerance has been widened to 12°C (22°F). Other statistics reveal that in 1962, a starter battery lasted 34 months; technical improvements increased the life expectancy in 2000 to 41 months. In 2010, BCI reported an average age of 55 months for starter batteries, with the cooler North attaining 59 months and the warmer South 47 months. Colloquial evidence in 2015 revealed that a battery kept in the trunk of a car lasted one year longer than if positioned in the engine compartment.\nThe life of a battery also depends on the activity, and the service life is shortened if the battery is stressed with frequent discharge. Cranking the engine a few times a day poses little stress on a starter battery, but this changes in the start-stop operation of a micro-hybrid. The micro-hybrid turns the internal combustion engine (ICE) off at red traffic lights and restarts it when the traffic flows again, resulting in about 2,000 micro-cycles per year. Data obtained from car manufacturers shows a capacity drop to about 60 percent after 2 years of use. To increase cycle life, automakers use specialty AGM and other systems(See BU-211: Alternate Battery Systems)\nFigure 1 shows a capacity drop from 100 percent to about 50 percent after the battery had been exposed to 700 micro cycles. The simulated start-stop test was performed in the Cadex laboratories. CCA remains high and only shows a decline after about 2,000 cycles.\nThe battery was fully charged and then discharged to 70% to resemble SoC of a micro hybrid in real life. The battery was then discharged at 25A for 40 seconds to simulate the engine off with the headlights on. To simulate cranking and driving, the battery was briefly discharged at 400A and then recharged. CCA was taken with the Spectro CA-12.\nWhen connected in series, the voltage of each cell must be uniform, and this is especially important in large stationary battery systems. With time, individual cells fall out of line but applying an equalizing charge every 6 months or so should bring the cells back to similar voltage levels. (See BU-404: Equalizing Charge) What makes this service so difficult is providing the right remedy to each cell. While equalizing will boost the needy cells, the healthy cell gets stressed if the equalizing charge is applied carelessly. Gel and AGM batteries have lower overcharge acceptance than the flooded version and different equalizing conditions apply.\nFlooded lead acid batteries are one of the most reliable systems and are well suited for hot climates. With good maintenance these batteries last up to 20 years. The disadvantages are the need for watering and good ventilation.\nWhen VRLA was introduced in the 1980s, manufacturers claimed similar life expectancy to the flooded systems, and the telecom industry was enticed to switch to these maintenance-free batteries. By mid-1990 it became apparent that the life of VRLA did not live up to the flooded type; the typical service life of the VRLA is 5–10 years, less than half of the flooded equivalent. It was furthermore noticed that exposing VRLA batteries to temperatures above 40°C (104°F) could cause a thermal runaway due to dry-out.\nThe 2005 failure-mode study was carried out by Douglas, East Penn., Exide Technologies and Johnson Controls. The sample battery pool included 2681 batteries tested between 2003 and 2004. The highlights include:\nFigure 3 summarizes the failure-mode distribution of more than 800 AGM starter batteries carried out by Johnson Controls Power Solutions EMEA. The results were presented at AABC Europe 2017 in Mainz, Germany.\nTable 1 summarizes the cause of failure derived from the JCI study.\nThe above JCI study identifying end of battery life provides similar results to the test performed by a German luxury car maker in ca 2007 involving 175 starter batteries. In this test, heat failed batteries (high internal resistance) were eliminated and the results were plotted in Figure 4. The horizontal axis represents capacity; internal resistance correlating to CCA is on the vertical axis. CCA was measured according to DIN and IEC standards.\nThe end-of-life of most batteries occurs by passing through the Capacity Line located on the left of the green field in Figure 4. Very few batteries failed by dropping through the CCA Line. Capacity fade occurs through normal use mostly due to loss of active mass. Auxiliary power, such as start-stop, heating elements and mechanical door actions accelerate capacity loss. Increased internal resistance is a side effect of the active mass loss, but capacity estimation is the more reliable predictor of end-of-life. This is highlighted with the batteries sitting gray dot. Also see: BU-806: Tracking Battery Capacity and Resistance as part of Aging\nMost batteries pass through the Capacity Line; few fail because of low CCA. The batteries were trunk mounted and driven in a moderate climate.\nNote: Test was done by a German luxury car maker. Heat damaged batteries were eliminated.\nTest Method: Capacity and CCA were tested according to DIN and IEC standards.\nSome makers of battery testers claim to measuring capacity when only reading the internal resistance. Advertising features that lay outside of the equipment’s capabilities confuses the industry into believing that complex tests can be done with basic methods. Resistance-based instruments can identify a dying or dead battery, but so does the user by poor cranking performance.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-902a-how-to-measure-cca",
        "content": "Ever since Cadillac invented the starter motor in 1912, car mechanics have explored ways to measure cold cranking amps (CCA). CCA measurements assure that the battery has sufficient power to crank the engine, especially when cold. Typical CCA readings for a car range from 350 to 600A and higher for trucks. SAE J537 specifies that a battery with a CCA reading of 500A can deliver 500A at –18°C (0°F) for 30 seconds without dropping below 7.2 volts.\nSource: BMW\nCCA cannot be “measured,” but it can be “estimated” and the process can take a week per battery. A full CCA test is tedious and is seldom done. To test CCA, apply different discharge currents to see which amperage keeps the battery above a set voltage while cold. Table 1 illustrates the test procedures according to SAE J537, IEC and DIN. The methods are similar and only differ in the length of discharge and the cut-off voltages.\nA variety of battery testers have emerged that read CCA. Since current flow relates to ohmic value, most CCA testers measure the internal battery resistance. To test the CCA with a carbon pile, a battery that must have an SoC of 70 to 100 percent. It is then loaded with half the rated CCA for 15 seconds at a temperature of 10º C (50º F) and higher. As an example, a 500 CCA battery will discharge at 250A for 15s, and the battery passes if the voltage stays above 9.6V. Colder temperatures will cause the voltage to drop further. The carbon pile simulates real-life cranking conditions while observing the voltage, but this method cannot estimate capacity.\nMechanics prefer small sizes and device manufactures have developed handheld testers, which induce a momentary high-current pulse that corresponds to the entered CCA value. Ohm’s law calculates the internal resistance on hand of the induced voltage drop, and the device provides a CCA-equivalent reading. This test method is fast and convenient, but it does not estimate capacity.\nThe AC conductance method reads CCA by injecting a single frequency of 80–90 hertz to the battery. These non-invasive units are small and stay cool during the test, but the battery should have a SoC of 70 percent and higher. As with other resistance-based test methods, AC conductance cannot read capacity.\nBattery scientists predict that future battery diagnostics lie in EIS by combining the test results of the Randles model with complex modeling to estimate CCA and capacity. Called multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the Spectro™-series battery rapid-testers (by Cadex) are the first to utilize the EIS technology(See BU-904: How to Measure Capacity)\nAccuracy has always been in question and CCA is especially difficult to verify as the readings are affected by SoC, temperature and and other factors. Figure 2 compares CCA readings taken with AC conductance and the Spectro™ technology at different SoC. Both measurements decline with lower SoC; however Spectro™ is affected less than AC conductance. Since many batteries hover at about 70 percent when the car is brought in for service, the CCA readings between the two methods will appear similar.\nThe Spectro CA-12 provides stable CCA readings between a SoC of 100 and 40% (red); the values on AC Conductance drop rapidly with SoC (blue).\nFigure 3 illustrates CCA readings as a function of SoC and battery performance. The CCA of Battery A, with a capacity of 100 percent, stays steady down to an SoC of 10 percent; Battery B, with 37 percent capacity, starts to show instabilities at an SoC of about 40 percent; and Battery C, with only 22 percent capacity, provides uncertain results. The test clearly demonstrates that battery state-of-health affects the readings. A good battery provides strong symptoms with good accuracy; the readings from a weak battery are muddled and the results are less consistent.\nThe battery condition governs accuracy. Battery A (100%) is accurate to 10% SoC; Battery B (37%) to 40% SoC. Battery C (22%) delivers unstable results.\nTest condition: Batteries are discharged at 20A. CCA is measured every 10 min with Spectro™\nNo single instrument can evaluate all battery anomalies and rapid-testing only provides rough estimations. A micro-short in a cell, for example, can only be identified by measuring the open circuit voltage (OCV) after a rest or checking the specific gravity of the electrolyte. Rapid-testing might pass the battery as good because a charge covers up the anomaly.\nAll test methods encounter outliers. Reliable results are only possible if robust symptoms are present. This is not always possible with unformatted batteries and those in storage. No ideal battery test method exists but EIS has the potential of surpassing other technologies.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-310-how-does-cobalt-work-in-li-ion",
        "content": "Cobalt was discovered by Swedish chemist Georg Brandt in 1739. It is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal that is extracted as a by-product when mining nickel and copper. Besides serving as a cathode material of many Li-ion batteries, cobalt is also used to make powerful magnets, high-speed cutting tools, and high-strength alloys for jet engines and gas turbines. Cobalt compounds have been employed for centuries to color porcelain, glass, pottery, tile and enamel; it is also important in human nutrition as part of vitamin B12. Figure 1 illustrates the breakdown of cobalt uses.\nCobalt is mostly retrieved as a byproduct from copper and nickel production. High cost entices battery manufacturers to seek alternatives, but cobalt cannot be entirely eliminated.\nBeing mostly a byproduct in the production of copper and nickel, the pricing follows the demand of these primary metals. This can lead to an over-supply of cobalt, as was the case in 2015. Cobalt prices were higher in 2010 and they are expected to pick up as the demand for large Li-ion batteries increases. Even at reduced prices, a ton of high grade cobalt runs at about US $28,000. This compares to US $6,000 for a ton of lithium carbonate (estimated 2015 prices). Lithium carbonate is a crystalline salt that is also used in glass and ceramic industries, as well as in medicine.\nAccording to the British Geological Survey (2014), the Democratic Republic of Congo has a 50 percent share of worldwide cobalt production; China, Canada, Australia and Russia are also major contributors. Cobalt in developing countries is often mined under life threating working conditions by adults and children with low pay.\nCobalt is an essential element for good health but too has a poisoning effect that can reflect in heart problems, damaged vision and cancer. Contact with cobalt can occur by ingestion, breathing cobalt contaminated air, or by constant skin contact. Cobalt poisoning has also been reported from the wear and tear of some cobalt/chromium metal-on-metal hip implants\nThe reuse of cobalt by recycling Li-ion batteries is only partially successful because of the refinements needed to bring the material back to battery-grade. (See also BU-705: How to Recycle Batteries) There should be no shortage of cobalt as the world has ample reserves.\nCobalt was the first cathode material for commercial Li-ion batteries, but a high price entices manufacturers to substitute the material. Cobalt blended with nickel, manganese and aluminum creates powerful cathode materials that are more economical and offer enhanced performance to pure cobalt.

        "title": "The Secrets of Battery Runtime",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/the-secrets-of-battery-runtime",
        "content": "NOTE: This article has been archived. Please read our new \"Four Renegades of Battery Failure\" for an updated version.\nEnergy storage in a battery can conceptually be divided into three imaginary segments of the available energy,the empty zone that can be refilled, and the unusable part (rock content). Figure 1 illustrates these three sections.\nFigure 1: Aging battery\nBatteries begin fading from the day they are manufactured.A new battery should deliver 100 percent capacity; most packs in use operate at less.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nAlthough the manufacturer specifies the runtime of portable equipment based on a battery performing at 100 percent, most packs in the field operate at less capacity. As time goes on, the performance declines further and the battery gets smaller in terms of holding capacity. A pack should be replaced when the capacity drops to 80 percent. This is only 20 percent down from 100 percent, and the end-of-life threshold may vary according to application and company policy.\nBesides age-related losses, sulfation and grid corrosion are the main killers of lead acid batteries. Sulfation is a thin layer that forms on the negative cell plate if the battery is allowed to dwell in a low state-of-charge. If sulfation is caught in time, an equalizing charge can reverse the condition. [BU-804, Sulfation] With nickel-based batteries, the so-called rock content is often the result of crystalline formation, also known as “memory,” and a full discharge can sometimes restore the battery. The aging process of lithium-ion is cell oxidation, a process that occurs naturally as part of usage and aging and cannot be reversed.\nHigh capacity has limited use if the battery is unable to deliver the stored energy effectively. To bring the power out, the battery needs low internal resistance. Measured in milliohms (mW), resistance is the gatekeeper of the battery; the lower the value, the less restriction the pack encounters. This is especially important with heavy loads and high current pulses, as elevated resistance causes the voltage to collapse and trigger an earlyshutdown. The device turns off and valuable energy is left behind. Figure 2 illustrates batteries with low and high internal resistance as free-flowing and restricted taps.\nFigure 2: Effects of internal battery resistance\nA battery with low internal resistance delivers high current on demand. High resistance causes the battery voltage to collapse. The equipment cuts off, leaving energy behind.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nLead acid has a very low internal resistance, and the battery responds well to high current bursts lasting for only a few seconds. Due to inherent sluggishness, however, lead acid does not perform well with a sustained discharge at high current and the battery needs rest to recover. Sulfation and grid corrosion are the main causes of increased internal resistance. Temperature also affects the resistance; heat lowers it and cold raises it.\nAlkaline, carbon-zinc and other primary batteries have relatively high internal resistance, and this relegates their use to low-current applications such as flashlights, remote controls, portable entertainment devices and kitchen clocks. As the batteries discharge, the resistance increases further. This explains why regular alkaline cells have a relatively short runtime in digital cameras. The high internal resistance limits most primary batteries to “soft” applications, and using them to drive power tools that draw high amperage is unthinkable.\nFigures 3, 4 and 5 reflect the talk-time of cellular phones with pulsed discharge loads of 1C, 2C and 3C, which GSM and CDMA demand. All batteries tested are similar in size and have capacities of 113%, 94% and 107% respectively, when checked with a battery analyzer on a DC discharge. The three graphs clearly demonstrate the importance of low internal resistance, which varies from a low 155mΩto a moderate 320mΩ, to a high 778mΩ respectively.\nFigure 3: GSM discharge pulses at 1, 2, and 3C with resulting talk-timeThe capacity of the NiCd battery is 113%; the internal resistance is 155mΩ.\nFigure 4: GSM discharge pulses at 1, 2, and 3C with resulting talk-timeThe capacity of the NiMH battery is 94%, the internal resistance is 320mΩ.\nFigure 5: GSM discharge pulses at 1, 2, and 3C with resulting talk-timeThe capacity of the Li-ion battery is 107%; the internal resistance is 778mΩ.\nAll three figures courtesy of Cadex\nNotes: The above tests were done on cellular phone batteries before lithium-ion took over as the leading battery type for this application. The internal resistance of a modern cellular battery is between 150 and 350mΩ.\nThe maximum discharge pulse current of GSM is 2.5 amperes. When drawn from an 800mAh pack, this represents a 3C discharge, or three times the rated current.\nAll batteries are affected by self-discharge. Self-discharge is not a manufacturing defect per se, although poor manufacturing practices and improper handling can promote the problem. The amount of electrical leakage varies with chemistry, and primary cells, such as lithium and alkaline, are among the best in retaining the energy. Nickel-based rechargeable systems, in comparison, leak the most and need recharging if the battery has not been used for a few days. High-performance nickel-based batteries are subject to higher self-discharge than the standard versions with lower energy densities. Figure 6 illustrates in the form of leaking fluids the self-discharge of a battery.\nFigure 6: Effects of high self-discharge\nSelf-discharge increases with age, cycling and elevated temperature. Discard a battery if the self-discharge reaches 30 percent in 24 hours.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nThe energy loss is asymptotical, meaning that the self-discharge is highest right after charge and then tapers off. Nickel-based batteries lose 10 to 15 percent of their capacity in the first 24 hours after charge, then 10 to 15 percent per month. Figure 7 shows the typical loss of a nickel-based battery while in storage.\nFigure 7: Self-discharge as a function of time\nThe discharge is highest right after charge and tapers off. The graph shows self-discharge of a nickel-based battery. Lead- and lithium-based system have a lower self-discharge.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nOne of the best batteries in terms of self-discharge is lead acid; it loses only five percent per month. This chemistry also has the lowest specific energy and is ill suited for portable use. Lithium-ion self-discharges about five percent in the first 24 hours and 1 to 2 percent thereafter. The need for the protection circuit increases the discharge by another three percent per month.\nThe self-discharge on all battery chemistries increases at higher temperatures and the rate typically doubles with every 10°C (18°F). A noticeable energy loss occurs if a battery is left in a hot vehicle. Cycling and aging also increase self-discharge. Nickel-metal-hydride is good for 300-400 cycles, whereas the standard nickel-cadmium lasts over 1,000 cycles before elevated self-discharge starts interfering with performance. The self-discharge on an older nickel-based battery can get so bad that the pack loses its energy mainly through leakage rather than normal use during the day. Discard a battery if the self-discharge reaches 30 percent in 24 hours.\nThe self-discharge of Li-ion is reasonably steady throughout the service life and does not increase noticeably with age, unless there is a cell anomaly caused by separator damage when microscopic metal particles group together. Improved manufacturing methods have minimized this problem on newer batteries.Table 8 reveals the self-discharge rate per month at various temperatures and state-of-charge conditions.\nCharge condition\n0°C (32°F)\n25°C (77°F)\n60°C (140°F)\nFull charge\n40–60% charge\n6%\n2%\n20%\n4%\n35%\n15%\nTable 8: Self-discharge of Li-ion at various temperatures and state-of-chargeSelf-discharge increases with rising temperature and higher SoC.\nOnce present, the high self-discharge of a flooded lead acid battery cannot be reversed. Factors leading to this failure are sludge buildup in the sediment trap on the bottom of the container. The sludge is semi-conductive, and when substance reaches to the plates a soft short occurs. On nickel-based batteries, a weakened or damaged separator is the cause of high self-discharge. Contributing factors are crystalline formation (memory), permitting the battery to “cook” in the charger or exposing it to repeated deep discharge cycles. A faulty separator also increases the self-discharge in lithium-ion batteries. In extreme cases, heat generated by the electrical leak further weakens the damaged separator. This can lead to a thermal breakdown.\nNot all stored battery energy can or should be used on discharge, and some reserve is almost always left behind when the equipment cuts off. There are several reasons for this.\nMost cell phones, laptops and other portable devices turn off when the lithium-ion battery reaches 3V/cell on discharge. The manufacturers choose this relatively high voltage threshold to allow for some self-discharge while in storage, giving a grace period before the protection circuit opens at about 2.5V/cell.\nA hybrid battery on a car never fully discharges and operates on a state-of-charge of 20 to 80 percent. This is the most effective working bandwidth of the battery, and staying within this range delivers the longest service life. A deep discharge with a full recharge causes undue stress to any battery, including Li-ion. Nickel-based batteries are similar, and because of reduced charge acceptance and heat buildup above the 80 percent SoC, the batteries are seldom fully charged. The emphasis on an electric powertrain is on maximizing service life rather than optimizing runtime (as is the case with consumer products).\nPower tools and medical devices that draw high currents push the battery voltage to an early cut-off. This is especially true if one of the cells has a high internal resistance, or when the battery is operating at cold temperatures. These batteries may still have ample capacity left after the “cut-off” and when discharging at moderate load, a battery analyzer may read a residual capacity of 30 percent. Figure 9 illustrates the cut-off voltage graphically.\nFigure 9: Illustration of equipment with high cut-off voltage\nPortable devices do not utilize all available battery power and leave some energy behind.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "As the world electrifies, battery diagnostics has been lagging behind core developments in batteries. Performance transparency must be equal to or higher than traditional energy systems that burn fossil fuels. Cadex realizes the importance of battery diagnostics and is developing rapid-test technologies that assess battery capacity, the leading health indicator.\nSpeakers at battery conferences have been promoting the life of a battery as a consumable product that begins with research; then moves to manufacturing, is placed into field deployment, and ends in recycling to retrieve valuable materials. While this business model is solid, one vital part in the life of a battery is missing — it’s diagnostic to enable the full use of each battery with a call for replacement before failure. Imagine life without a doctor to fix our ailments.\nAdvancements in battery diagnostics are visible and this includes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). While the research is mostly done with lab-stressed batteries, commercializing the technology to make performance on field-aged batteries visible to untrained staff is still missing.\nCadex solved this limitation in an instrument that creates a Nyquist plot that is modeled against a matrix to extract battery capacity and other data. Test accuracies rest on the integrity of the matrix that is composed by taking performance data from aged batteries of same-model. The technology is able to assess battery state-of-health (SoH) of lead-acid and lithium-ion systems.\nBeing first to market to provide battery performance by exploiting EIS data is reminiscent of Thomas Edison who used a glowing filament to commercialize the light bulb. As the Edison light bulb illuminated the world in 1879, scientists predict that the future of battery diagnostics rests in EIS. The full potential of this technology has not yet been fully explored; much rests on the integrity of the matrix.\nMulti-model EIS, called Spectro™, holds several patents. With close to 10,000 Spectro battery testers in service to date, the devices are non-invasive, compact, cost-effective, and easy to use. Test time is roughly 30 seconds, longer with large batteries with capacities of up to 300Ah requiring very low frequencies.\nWith time, several battery test methods have emerged that are captured in Figure 2. A low numbers in the Battery Diagnostic Pyramid reflect an older and more basic approach while higher numbers include some form of training in use.\nEIS stands on its own by comparing test results with a matrix serving as lookup table that is analogous to face recognition using AI. Of importance with all test methods is the ability to assess capacity, the gatekeeper that governs the remaining useful life of a battery.\nNo universal battery test methods exist that serve all applications. Here is a summary of the best uses.\nAll battery applications benefit from diagnostics. Service personnel are aware of the weakest link and say: “Half of all breakdowns are caused by the battery.” Service centers take special care and only release a device by also checking the battery. Think of the passport officer inspecting your credentials when traveling.\nBattery testing by EIS also enables monitoring batteries that had been installed and forgotten. Cloud Analytics observes the Minimum Operational Reserve Energy (MORE), a feature EIS offers with capacity assessment. Battery replacement is thus ruled by MORE when a faded battery can no longer provide the operational reserve energy needed. Think of EIS as the technology that makes batteries transparent.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Advancements in Lead Acid",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/advancements-in-lead-acid",
        "content": "Invented by the French physician Gaston Planté in 1859, lead acid was the first rechargeable battery for commercial use. Early models were flooded, and during the mid-1970s the sealed or maintenance-free versions emerged in which the liquid electrolyte is transformed into moistened separators and the assembly is placed in a sealed enclosure. Safety valves control the venting of the gases generated during charge and discharge. The sealed enclosure simplifies transportation and allows installing the battery sideways without spillage.\nThere are two basic types of lead acids: the starter battery and the deep-cycle battery. The starter battery is designed to crank the vehicle engine, and the deep-cycle battery is made to provide continuous power in golf cars, wheelchairs, forklifts and standby systems. From the outside, these batteries look alike but there are fundamental differences in design. While the starter battery is made for a high peak power of several hundred amperes and cannot be deep cycled, the deep-cycle battery has moderate power output but permits cycling. Let us now look at the mechanical differences between these two battery systems.\nStarter batteries have a very low internal resistance and this is achieved by adding extra plates for maximum surface area (Figure 1). The plates are thin and the lead is applied in a sponge-like form that has the appearance of fine foam. This extends the surface area on the plates to achieve low resistance and maximum power density (current handling). Plate thickness isless important because the discharge is short and the battery recharges while driving;the emphasis is on power rather than capacity.\nFigure 1: Starter battery\nThe starter battery has many thin plates in parallel to achieve low resistance with high surface area. The starter battery does not allow deep cycling.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nStarter batteries are marked with CCA (cold cranking amps), which represents the amount of current a battery can deliver at cold temperature. To test CCA under SAE J537, the battery is cooled to –18°C (0°F) and discharged for 30 seconds at the rated CCA. A battery marked 600 CCA would be discharged at 600A for 30 seconds at –18°C (0°F). During discharge, the voltage cannot drop below 7.2 volts. If it does, the battery fails and the CCA test must be repeated to find the true CCA value. [see BU-902a: How to Measure CCA (Cold Cranking Amp)] and [see BU-904: How to Measure Capacity] Most starter batteries are also marked with RC (reserve capacity) or Ah (ampere hours).\nDeep-cycle lead acid batteries are built for maximum capacity and high cycle count, and this is achieved by making the lead plates thick (Figure 2). Although the battery is designed for cycling, full discharges still induce stress. It is advised to keep the cycles moderate by preventing a full discharge and allowing the battery to charge more often. Deep-cycle batteries are marked in Ah, indicating the current the battery can deliver over time. At 1C, for example, a 60Ah battery should deliver 60A for one hour. [see BU-402: What is the C-rate?]\nFigure 2: Deep-cycle battery\nThe deep-cycle battery has thick plates for improved cycling abilities. The deep-cycle battery generally allows about 300 cycles.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nA starter battery cannot be swapped with a deep-cycle battery and vice versa. While a senior may be tempted to install a low-cost starter battery instead of the more expensive deep-cycle in his wheelchair, the starter battery won’t last because the thin sponge-like plates would quickly dissolve with repeated deep cycling. Trucks, buses, public safety and military vehicles use a combination of starter/deep-cycle battery, but these are big and heavy. As a simple guideline: the heavier the battery, the more lead it contains, and the longer it will last. Table 3 compares the typical life of starter and deep-cycle batteries when deep-cycled.\nDepth of Discharge\nStarter Battery\nDeep-cycle Battery\n100%\n50%\n30%\n12–15 cycles\n100–120 cycles\n130–150 cycles\n150–200 cycles\n400–500 cycles\n1,000 and more cycles\nTable 3: Cycle performance of starter and deep-cycle batteries. Starter batteries and deep-cycle batteries have their unique purposes and cannot be interchanged.\nEver since Cadillac introduced the electric starter motor in 1912, lead acid remains the natural battery choice for engine cranking. Lead is toxic and environmentalists are trying to find an alternative. Europe succeeded in keeping nickel-cadmium batteries out of consumer products, and authorities want to do the same with the starter battery. The alternative is lithium-ion, but the cold-start performance is not as good as lead acid and the price is too high.\nStart-stop in micro-hybrid cars stresses a regular lead acid battery and shortens the life. To get a long lifespan on continuous start/stop and allow fast charging to utilize the energy from regenerative braking, battery manufacturers are refining existing technologies and experimenting with new systems. Below is a list of existing and new lead acid batteries.\nAGM is an improved lead acid battery with higher performance than the regular flooded type. Instead of submerging the plates into liquid electrolyte, the electrolyte is absorbed in a mat of fine glass fibers. This makes the battery spill-proof, allowing shipment without hazardous material restrictions. The plates can be made flat like the standard flooded lead acid and placed in a rectangular case, or wound into a conventional cylindrical cell.\nAGM has very low internal resistance, is capable of delivering high currents and offers long service even if occasionally deep-cycled. AGM has a lower weight and provides better electrical reliability than the flooded lead acid type. It also stands up well to high and low temperatures and has a low self-discharge. Other advantages over regular lead acid are a better specific power rating (high load current) and faster charge times (up to five times faster). The negatives are slightly lower specific energy (capacity) and higher manufacturing costs.\nAGM batteries are commonly built to size and are found in high-end vehicles to run power-hungry accessories such as heated seats, steering wheels, mirrors and windshield wipers. Starter batteries also power navigation systems, traction and stability control, as well as premium stereos. NASCAR and other auto racing leagues choose AGM products because they are vibration resistant. Start-stop batteries are almost exclusively AGM because the classic flooded type is not robust enough; repeated micro cycling would induce capacity fade. [see BU-806a: How Heat and Loading affect Battery Life]\nAGM is the preferred battery for upscale motorcycles. It reduces acid spilling in an accident, lowers weight for the same performance and can be installed odd angles. Because of good performance at cold temperatures, AGM batteries are also used for marine, motor home and robotic applications.\nAs with all gelled and sealed units, AGM batteries are sensitive to overcharging. These batteries can be charged to 2.40V/cell (and higher) without problem; however, the float charge should be reduced to between 2.25 and 2.30V/cell (summer temperatures may require lower voltages). Automotive charging systems for flooded lead acid often have a fixed float voltage setting of 14.40V (2.40V/cell), and a direct replacement with a sealed unit could spell trouble by exposing the battery to undue overcharge on a long drive. [see BU-403: Charging Lead Acid]\nAGM and other gelled electrolyte batteries do not like heat and should be installed away from the engine compartment. Manufacturers recommend halting charge if the battery core reaches 49°C (120°F). While regular lead acid batteries need a topping charge every six months to prevent the buildup of sulfation, AGM batteries are less prone and can sit in storage for longer before a charge becomes necessary.\nThe following are important lead acid systems in limited use or under field test.\nThe Axion Power e3 Supercell is a hybrid battery/ultracapacitor in which the positive electrode consists of standard lead dioxide and the negative electrode is activated carbon. The assembly process is similar to lead acid. The battery offers faster recharge times and longer cycle life on repeated deep discharges than with regular lead acid systems, and this opens the door for the start-stop application. The lead-carbon combination of the Axion Power battery lowers the lead content on the negative plate, which results in a 30 percent weight reduction compared to a regular lead acid. This also lowers the specific energy to 15–25Wh/kg instead of 30–50Wh/kg of a regular lead acid battery.\nThe Altraverda battery is based on lead and uses a proprietary titanium sub-oxide ceramic structure called Ebonex® for the grid and an AGM separator. The un-pasted plate contains Ebonex® particles in a polymer matrix that holds a thin lead alloy foil on the external surfaces. With 50–60Wh/kg, the specific energy is about one-third larger than regular lead acid and is comparable with NiCd. Based in the UK, Altraverda works with East Penn in the USA, and the battery is well suited for higher voltage applications.\nThe composite plate material of the Firefly Energy battery is based on a lead-acid variant that is lighter, longer living, and has higher active material utilization than current lead acid systems. It is also one of the few lead-acid batteries that can operate for extended time in partial-states-of-charge. The battery includes carbon-foam electrodes for the negative plates, which gives it a performance that is comparable to NiMH but at lower manufacturing costs. Firefly Energy was a spin-off of Caterpillar and in 2010 went into bankruptcy. The company was revived under separate ownership. Today, Firefly International Energy manufactures the Oasis line of batteries in limited quantities in the US.\nThe CSIRO Ultrabattery combines an asymmetric ultracapacitor and a lead acid battery in each cell. The capacitor enhances the specific power by acting as a buffer during charge and discharge. This produces 50 percent more power than a regular lead acid. Furthermore, the ultracapacitor/lead acid combination is said to prolong the battery service life by a factor of four. The manufacturer also claims that the battery is 70 percent cheaper to produce than current hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) batteries. CSIRO batteries are able to take fast charge to capture the energy from regenerative breaking. The battery is being tested for start-stop applications and is undergoing road trials in a Honda Insight HEV with good results. Furukawa Battery licensed the technology.\nEEStor is also based on the battery/ultracapacitor combination but goes further by using a modified barium titanate ceramic powder. The battery claims to have a specific energy of up to 280Wh/kg, higher than lithium-ion. The company only releases limited information and their claims are: One-tenth of the weight of NiMH in a hybrid application, no deep-cycle wear-down, 2–6 minute charge time, no hazardous material, similar manufacturing costs to lead acid, and a self-discharge that is only 0.02 percent per month, a fraction of lead acid and Li-ion. Some claims may be simply too good to be true and the real test will be everyday field use.\nBatteries seem to advance slowly and this is especially apparent when comparing batteries to the rapid developments of other technologies. This is not idleness on part of the research engineers but overcoming insurmountable technical hurdles to meet the requirements of long life, high specific energy (capacity), safe operation, minimal maintenance and low price. In addition, the battery must work at hot and cold temperatures, deliver high power on demand, charge quickly and be environmentally friendly. No battery meets all criteria and manufacturers optimize the characteristics to meet user demands. As long as the battery is based on the electrochemical process, limitations will remain.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Like humans, batteries function best at room temperature. Warming a dying battery in a mobile phone or flashlight in our jeans might provide additional runtime due to improved electrochemical reaction. This is likely also the reason why manufacturers prefer to specify batteries at a toasty 27°C (80°F). Operating a battery at elevated temperatures improves performance but prolonged exposure will shorten life.\nAs all drivers in cold countries know, a warm battery cranks the car engine better than a cold one. Cold temperature increases the internal resistance and lowers the capacity. A battery that provides 100 percent capacity at 27°C (80°F) will typically deliver only 50 percent at –18°C (0°F). The momentary capacity-decrease differs with battery chemistry.\nThe dry solid polymer battery requires a temperature of 60–100°C (140–212°F) to promote ion flow and become conductive. This type of battery has found a niche market for stationary power applications in hot climates where heat serves as a catalyst rather than a disadvantage. Built-in heating elements keep the battery operational at all times. High battery cost and safety concerns have limited the application of this system. The more common lithium-polymer uses gelled electrolyte to enhance conductivity.\nAll batteries achieve optimum service life if used at 20°C (68°F) or slightly below. If, for example, a battery operates at 30°C (86°F) instead of a more moderate lower room temperature, the cycle life is reduced by 20 percent. At 40°C (104°F), the loss jumps to a whopping 40 percent, and if charged and discharged at 45°C (113°F), the cycle life is only half of what can be expected if used at 20°C (68°F). (See also BU-808: How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries)\nThe performance of all batteries drops drastically at low temperatures; however, the elevated internal resistance will cause some warming effect by efficiency loss caused by voltage drop when applying a load current. At –20°C (–4°F) most batteries are at about 50 percent performance level. Although NiCd can go down to –40°C (–40°F), the permissible discharge is only 0.2C (5-hour rate). Specialty Li-ion can operate to a temperature of –40°C but only at a reduced discharge rate; charging at this temperature is out of the question. With lead acid there is the danger of the electrolyte freezing, which can crack the enclosure. Lead acid freezes quicker with a low charge when the specific gravity is more like water than when fully charged.\nFigure 1 illustrates the discharge voltage of an 18650 Li-ion under various temperatures. A 3A discharge of a 2.8Ah cell represents a C-rate of 1.07C. The reduced capacity at low temperature only applies while the cell is in that condition and will recover in room temperature.\nMatched cells with identical capacities play an important role when discharging at low temperature and under heavy load. Since the cells in a battery pack can never be perfectly matched, a negative voltage potential can occur across a weaker cell in a multi-cell pack if the discharge is allowed to continue beyond a safe cut-off point. Known as cell reversal, the weak cell gets stressed to the point of developing a permanent electrical short. The larger the cell-count, the greater is the likelihood of cell-reversal under load. Over-discharge at a low temperature and heavy load is a large contributor to battery failure of cordless power tools. (See BU-803a: Cell Matching and Balancing)\nThe driving range of an electric vehicle between charges is calculated at ambient temperature. EV drivers are being made aware that frigid temperature reduces the available mileage. This loss is not only caused by heating the cabin electrically but by the inherent slowing of the battery’s electrochemical reaction, which reduces the capacity while cold.\n[1] Source: Technische Universität München (TUM)\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Four Renegades of Battery Failure",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/four-renegades-of-battery-failure",
        "content": "Energy storage in a battery can conceptually be divided into three imaginary segments of the available energy,the empty zonethat can be refilled, and the unusable part(rock content). Figure 1 illustrates these three sections.\nFigure 1: Aging battery\nBatteries begin fading from the day they are manufactured.A new battery should deliver 100 percent capacity; most packs in use operate at less.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nAlthough the manufacturer specifies the runtime of portable equipment based on a battery performing at 100 percent, most packs in the field operate at less capacity. As time goes on, the performance declines further and the battery gets smaller in terms of holding capacity. A pack should be replaced when the capacity drops to 80 percent. This is only 20 percent down from 100 percent, and the end-of-life threshold may vary according to application and company policy.\nBesides age-related losses, sulfation and grid corrosion are the main killers of lead acid batteries. Sulfation is a thin layer that forms on the negative cell plate if the battery is allowed to dwell in a low state-of-charge. If sulfation is caught in time, an equalizing charge can reverse the condition. Read more about Sulfation. With nickel-based batteries, the so-called rock content is often the result of crystalline formation, also known as “memory,” and a full discharge can sometimes restore the battery. The aging process of lithium-ion is cell oxidation, a process that occurs naturally as part of usage and aging and cannot be reversed.\nHigh capacity has limited use if the battery is unable to deliver the stored energy effectively. To bring the power out, the battery needs low internal resistance. Measured in milliohms (mΩ), resistance is the gatekeeper of the battery; the lower the value, the less restriction the pack encounters. This is especially important with heavy loads and high current pulses, as elevated resistance causes the voltage to collapse and trigger an earlyshutdown. The device turns off and valuable energy is left behind. Figure 2 illustrates batteries with low and high internal resistance as free-flowing and restricted taps.\nFigure 2: Effects of internal battery resistance\nA battery with low internal resistance delivers high current on demand. High resistance causes the battery voltage to collapse. The equipment cuts off, leaving energy behind.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nLead acid has a very low internal resistance, and the battery responds well to high current bursts lasting for only a few seconds. Due to inherent sluggishness, however, lead acid does not perform well with a sustained discharge at high current and the battery needs rest to recover. Sulfation and grid corrosion are the main causes of increased internal resistance. Temperature also affects the resistance; heat lowers it and cold raises it.\nAlkaline, carbon-zinc and other primary batteries have relatively high internal resistance, and this relegates their use to low-current applications such as flashlights, remote controls, portable entertainment devices and kitchen clocks. As the batteries discharge, the resistance increases further. This explains why regular alkaline cells have a relatively short runtime in digital cameras. The high internal resistance limits most primary batteries to “soft” applications, and using them to drive power tools that draw high amperage is unthinkable.\nAll batteries are affected by self-discharge. Self-discharge is not a manufacturing defect per se, although poor manufacturing practices and improper handling can promote the problem. The amount of electrical leakage varies with chemistry, and primary cells, such as lithium and alkaline, are among the best in retaining the energy. Nickel-based rechargeable systems, in comparison, leak the most and need recharging if the battery has not been used for a few days. High-performance nickel-based batteries are subject to higher self-discharge than the standard versions with lower energy densities. Figure 6 illustrates in the form of leaking fluids the self-discharge of a battery.\nFigure 6: Effects of high self-discharge\nSelf-discharge increases with age, cycling and elevated temperature. Discard a battery if the self-discharge reaches 30 percent in 24 hours.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nThe energy loss is asymptotical, meaning that the self-discharge is highest right after charge and then tapers off. Nickel-based batteries lose 10 to 15 percent of their capacity in the first 24 hours after charge, then 10 to 15 percent per month. Figure 7 shows the typical loss of a nickel-based battery while in storage.\nFigure 7: Self-discharge as a function of time\nThe discharge is highest right after charge and tapers off. The graph shows self-discharge of a nickel-based battery. Lead- and lithium-based system have a lower self-discharge.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nOne of the best batteries in terms of self-discharge is lead acid; it loses only five percent per month. This chemistry also has the lowest specific energy and is ill suited for portable use. Lithium-ion self-discharges about five percent in the first 24 hours and 1 to 2 percent thereafter. The need for the protection circuit increases the discharge by another three percent per month.\nThe self-discharge on all battery chemistries increases at higher temperatures and the rate typically doubles with every 10°C (18°F). A noticeable energy loss occurs if a battery is left in a hot vehicle. Cycling and aging also increase self-discharge. Nickel-metal-hydride is good for 300-400 cycles, whereas the standard nickel-cadmium lasts over 1,000 cycles before elevated self-discharge starts interfering with performance. The self-discharge on an older nickel-based battery can get so bad that the pack loses its energy mainly through leakage rather than normal use during the day. Discard a battery if the self-discharge reaches 30 percent in 24 hours.\nThe self-discharge of Li-ion is reasonably steady throughout the service life and does not increase noticeably with age, unless there is a cell anomaly caused by separator damage when microscopic metal particles group together. Improved manufacturing methods have minimized this problem on newer batteries.Table 8 reveals the self-discharge rate per month at various temperatures and state-of-charge conditions.\nCharge condition\n0°C (32°F)\n25°C (77°F)\n60°C (140°F)\nFull charge\n40–60% charge\n6%\n2%\n20%\n4%\n35%\n15%\nTable 8: Self-discharge of Li-ion at various temperatures and state-of-chargeSelf-discharge increases with rising temperature and higher SoC.\nOnce present, the high self-discharge of a flooded lead acid battery cannot be reversed. Factors leading to this failure are sludge buildup in the sediment trap on the bottom of the container. The sludge is semi-conductive, and when substance reaches to the plates a soft short occurs. On nickel-based batteries, a weakened or damaged separator is the cause of high self-discharge. Contributing factors are crystalline formation (memory), permitting the battery to “cook” in the charger or exposing it to repeated deep discharge cycles. A faulty separator also increases the self-discharge in lithium-ion batteries. In extreme cases, heat generated by the electrical leak further weakens the damaged separator. This can lead to a thermal breakdown.\nNot all stored battery energy can or should be used on discharge, and some reserve is almost always left behind when the equipment cuts off. There are several reasons for this.\nMost cell phones, laptops and other portable devices turn off when the lithium-ion battery reaches 3V/cell on discharge. The manufacturers choose this relatively high voltage threshold to allow for some self-discharge while in storage, giving a grace period before the protection circuit opens at about 2.5V/cell.\nA hybrid battery on a car never fully discharges and operates on a state-of-charge of 20 to 80 percent. This is the most effective working bandwidth of the battery, and staying within this range delivers the longest service life. A deep discharge with a full recharge causes undue stress to any battery, including Li-ion. Nickel-based batteries are similar, and because of reduced charge acceptance and heat buildup above the 80 percent SoC, the batteries are seldom fully charged. The emphasis on an electric powertrain is on maximizing service life rather than optimizing runtime (as is the case with consumer products).\nPower tools and medical devices that draw high currents push the battery voltage to an early cut-off. This is especially true if one of the cells has a high internal resistance, or when the battery is operating at cold temperatures. These batteries may still have ample capacity left after the “cut-off” and when discharging at moderate load, a battery analyzer may read a residual capacity of 30 percent. Figure 9 illustrates the cut-off voltage graphically.\nFigure 9: Illustration of equipment with high cut-off voltage\nPortable devices do not utilize all available battery power and leave some energy behind.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "What's the Best Battery?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/whats-the-best-battery",
        "content": "We often get puzzled by announcements of new batteries that are said to offer very high energy densities, deliver 1000 charge/discharge cycle and are paper-thin. Are they real? Perhaps — but not in one and the same battery. While one battery type may be designed for small size and long runtime, this pack will not last and wear out prematurely. Another battery may be built for long life, but the size is big and bulky. A third battery may provide all the desirable attributes, but the price would be too high for commercial use.\nBattery manufacturers are well aware of customer needs and have responded by offering packs that best suit the specific applications. The mobile phone industry is an example of clever adaptation. Emphasis is placed on small size, high energy density and low price. Longevity comes in second.\nThe inscription of NiMH on a battery pack does not automatically guarantee high energy density. A prismatic Nickel-Metal Hydride battery for a mobile phone, for example, is made for slim geometry. Such a pack provides an energy density of about 60Wh/kg and the cycle count is around 300. In comparison, a cylindrical NiMH offers energy densities of 80Wh/kg and higher. Still, the cycle count of this battery is moderate to low. High durability NiMH batteries, which endure 1000 discharges, are commonly packaged in bulky cylindrical cells. The energy density of these cells is a modest 70Wh/kg.\nCompromises also exist on lithium-based batteries. Li‑ion packs are being produced for defense applications that far exceed the energy density of the commercial equivalent. Unfortunately, these super-high capacity Li‑ion batteries are deemed unsafe in the hands of the public and the high price puts them out of reach of the commercial market.\nIn this article we look at the advantages and limitations of the commercial battery. The so-called miracle battery that merely live in controlled environments is excluded. We scrutinize the batteries not only in terms of energy density but also longevity, load characteristics, maintenance requirements, self-discharge and operational costs. Since NiCd remains a standard against which other batteries are compared, we evaluate alternative chemistries against this classic battery type.\nNickel Cadmium (NiCd) — mature and well understood but relatively low in energy density. The NiCd is used where long life, high discharge rate and economical price are important. Main applications are two-way radios, biomedical equipment, professional video cameras and power tools. The NiCd contains toxic metals and is environmentally unfriendly.\nNickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) — has a higher energy density compared to the NiCd at the expense of reduced cycle life. NiMH contains no toxic metals. Applications include mobile phones and laptop computers.\nLead Acid — most economical for larger power applications where weight is of little concern. The lead acid battery is the preferred choice for hospital equipment, wheelchairs, emergency lighting and UPS systems.\nLithium Ion (Li‑ion) — fastest growing battery system. Li‑ion is used where high-energy density and lightweight is of prime importance. The technology is fragile and a protection circuit is required to assure safety. Applications include notebook computers and cellular phones.\nLithium Ion Polymer (Li‑ion polymer) — offers the attributes of the Li-ion in ultra-slim geometry and simplified packaging. Main applications are mobile phones.\nFigure 1 compares the characteristics of the six most commonly used rechargeable battery systems in terms of energy density, cycle life, exercise requirements and cost. The figures are based on average ratings of commercially available batteries at the time of publication.\nFigure 1: Characteristics of commonly used rechargeable batteries\nObservation: It is interesting to note that NiCd has the shortest charge time, delivers the highest load current and offers the lowest overall cost-per-cycle, but has the most demanding maintenance requirements.\nThe NiCd prefers fast charge to slow charge and pulse charge to DC charge. All other chemistries prefer a shallow discharge and moderate load currents. The NiCd is a strong and silent worker; hard labor poses no problem. In fact, the NiCd is the only battery type that performs well under rigorous working conditions. It does not like to be pampered by sitting in chargers for days and being used only occasionally for brief periods. A periodic full discharge is so important that, if omitted, large crystals will form on the cell plates (also referred to as memory) and the NiCd will gradually lose its performance.\nAmong rechargeable batteries, NiCd remains a popular choice for applications such as two-way radios, emergency medical equipment and power tools. Batteries with higher energy densities and less toxic metals are causing a diversion from NiCd to newer technologies.\nAdvantages and Limitations of NiCd Batteries\nAdvantages\nFast and simple charge — even after prolonged storage.\nHigh number of charge/discharge cycles — if properly maintained, the NiCd provides over 1000 charge/discharge cycles.\nGood load performance — the NiCd allows recharging at low temperatures.\nLong shelf life – in any state-of-charge.\nSimple storage and transportation — most airfreight companies accept the NiCd without special conditions.\nGood low temperature performance.\nForgiving if abused — the NiCd is one of the most rugged rechargeable batteries.\nEconomically priced — the NiCd is the lowest cost battery in terms of cost per cycle.\nAvailable in a wide range of sizes and performance options — most NiCd cells are cylindrical.\nLimitations\nRelatively low energy density — compared with newer systems.\nMemory effect — the NiCd must periodically be exercised to prevent memory.\nEnvironmentally unfriendly — the NiCd contains toxic metals. Some countries are limiting the use of the NiCd battery.\nHas relatively high self-discharge — needs recharging after storage.\nFigure 2: Advantages and limitations of NiCd batteries.\nResearch of the NiMH system started in the 1970s as a means of discovering how to store hydrogen for the nickel hydrogen battery. Today, nickel hydrogen batteries are mainly used for satellite applications. They are bulky, contain high-pressure steel canisters and cost thousands of dollars per cell.\nIn the early experimental days of the NiMH battery, the metal hydride alloys were unstable in the cell environment and the desired performance characteristics could not be achieved. As a result, the development of the NiMH slowed down. New hydride alloys were developed in the 1980s that were stable enough for use in a cell. Since the late 1980s, NiMH has steadily improved.\nThe success of the NiMH has been driven by its high energy density and the use of environmentally friendly metals. The modern NiMH offers up to 40 percent higher energy density compared to NiCd. There is potential for yet higher capacities, but not without some negative side effects.\nThe NiMH is less durable than the NiCd. Cycling under heavy load and storage at high temperature reduces the service life. The NiMH suffers from high self-discharge, which is considerably greater than that of the NiCd.\nThe NiMH has been replacing the NiCd in markets such as wireless communications and mobile computing. In many parts of the world, the buyer is encouraged to use NiMH rather than NiCd batteries. This is due to environmental concerns about careless disposal of the spent battery.\nExperts agree that the NiMH has greatly improved over the years, but limitations remain. Most of the shortcomings are native to the nickel-based technology and are shared with the NiCd battery. It is widely accepted that NiMH is an interim step to lithium battery technology.\nAdvantages and Limitations of NiMH Batteries\nAdvantages\n30 – 40 percent higher capacity over a standard NiCd. The NiMH has potential for yet higher energy densities.\nLess prone to memory than the NiCd. Periodic exercise cycles are required less often.\nSimple storage and transportation — transportation conditions are not subject to regulatory control.\nEnvironmentally friendly — contains only mild toxins; profitable for recycling.\nLimitations\nLimited service life — if repeatedly deep cycled, especially at high load currents, the performance starts to deteriorate after 200 to 300 cycles. Shallow rather than deep discharge cycles are preferred.\nLimited discharge current — although a NiMH battery is capable of delivering high discharge currents, repeated discharges with high load currents reduces the battery’s cycle life. Best results are achieved with load currents of 0.2C to 0.5C (one-fifth to one-half of the rated capacity).\nMore complex charge algorithm needed — the NiMH generates more heat during charge and requires a longer charge time than the NiCd. The trickle charge is critical and must be controlled carefully.\nHigh self-discharge — the NiMH has about 50 percent higher self-discharge compared to the NiCd. New chemical additives improve the self-discharge but at the expense of lower energy density.\nPerformance degrades if stored at elevated temperatures — the NiMH should be stored in a cool place and at a state-of-charge of about 40 percent.\nHigh maintenance — battery requires regular full discharge to prevent crystalline formation.\nAbout 20 percent more expensive than NiCd — NiMH batteries designed for high current draw are more expensive than the regular version.\nFigure 3: Advantages and limitations of NiMH batteries\nInvented by the French physician Gaston Planté in 1859, lead acid was the first rechargeable battery for commercial use. Today, the flooded lead acid battery is used in automobiles, forklifts and large uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems.\nDuring the mid 1970s, researchers developed a maintenance-free lead acid battery that could operate in any position. The liquid electrolyte was transformed into moistened separators and the enclosure was sealed. Safety valves were added to allow venting of gas during charge and discharge.\nDriven by different applications, two battery designations emerged. They are the small sealed lead acid (SLA), also known under the brand name of Gelcell, and the large valve regulated lead acid (VRLA). Technically, both batteries are the same. (Engineers may argue that the word ‘sealed lead acid’ is a misnomer because no lead acid battery can be totally sealed.) Because of our emphasis on portable batteries, we focus on the SLA.\nUnlike the flooded lead acid battery, both the SLA and VRLA are designed with a low over-voltage potential to prohibit the battery from reaching its gas-generating potential during charge. Excess charging would cause gassing and water depletion. Consequently, these batteries can never be charged to their full potential.\nThe lead acid is not subject to memory. Leaving the battery on float charge for a prolonged time does not cause damage. The battery’s charge retention is best among rechargeable batteries. Whereas the NiCd self-discharges approximately 40 percent of its stored energy in three months, the SLA self-discharges the same amount in one year. The SLA is relatively inexpensive to purchase but the operational costs can be more expensive than the NiCd if full cycles are required on a repetitive basis.\nThe SLA does not lend itself to fast charging — typical charge times are 8 to 16 hours. The SLA must always be stored in a charged state. Leaving the battery in a discharged condition causes sulfation, a condition that makes the battery difficult, if not impossible, to recharge.\nUnlike the NiCd, the SLA does not like deep cycling. A full discharge causes extra strain and each cycle robs the battery of a small amount of capacity. This wear-down characteristic also applies to other battery chemistries in varying degrees. To prevent the battery from being stressed through repetitive deep discharge, a larger SLA battery is recommended.\nDepending on the depth of discharge and operating temperature, the SLA provides 200 to 300 discharge/ charge cycles. The primary reason for its relatively short cycle life is grid corrosion of the positive electrode, depletion of the active material and expansion of the positive plates. These changes are most prevalent at higher operating temperatures. Cycling does not prevent or reverse the trend.\nThe optimum operating temperature for the SLA and VRLA battery is 25°C (77°F). As a rule of thumb, every 8°C (15°F) rise in temperature will cut the battery life in half. VRLA that would last for 10 years at 25°C will only be good for 5 years if operated at 33°C (95°F). The same battery would endure a little more than one year at a temperature of 42°C (107°F).\nAmong modern rechargeable batteries, the lead acid battery family has the lowest energy density, making it unsuitable for handheld devices that demand compact size. In addition, performance at low temperatures is poor.\nThe SLA is rated at a 5-hour discharge or 0.2C. Some batteries are even rated at a slow 20-hour discharge. Longer discharge times produce higher capacity readings. The SLA performs well on high pulse currents. During these pulses, discharge rates well in excess of 1C can be drawn.\nIn terms of disposal, the SLA is less harmful than the NiCd battery but the high lead content makes the SLA environmentally unfriendly.\nAdvantages and Limitations of Lead Acid Batteries\nAdvantages\nInexpensive and simple to manufacture — in terms of cost per watt hours, the SLA is the least expensive.\nMature, reliable and well-understood technology — when used correctly, the SLA is durable and provides dependable service.\nLow self-discharge —the self-discharge rate is among the lowest in rechargeable batterysystems.\nLow maintenance requirements — no memory; no electrolyte to fill.\nCapable of high discharge rates.\nLimitations\nCannot be stored in a discharged condition.\nLow energy density — poor weight-to-energy density limits use to stationary and wheeled applications.\nAllows only a limited number of full discharge cycles — well suited for standby applications that require only occasional deep discharges.\nEnvironmentally unfriendly — the electrolyte and the lead content can cause environmental damage.\nTransportation restrictions on flooded lead acid — there are environmental concerns regarding spillage in case of an accident.\nThermal runaway can occur with improper charging.\nFigure 4: Advantages and limitations of lead acid batteries.\nPioneer work with the lithium battery began in 1912 under G.N. Lewis but it was not until the early 1970s that the first non-rechargeable lithium batteries became commercially available. Lithium is the lightest of all metals, has the greatest electrochemical potential and provides the largest energy density per weight.\nAttempts to develop rechargeable lithium batteries followed in the 1980s, but failed due to safety problems. Because of the inherent instability of lithium metal, especially during charging, research shifted to a non-metallic lithium battery using lithium ions. Although slightly lower in energy density than lithium metal, the Li‑ion is safe, provided certain precautions are met when charging and discharging. In 1991, the Sony Corporation commercialized the first Li‑ion battery. Other manufacturers followed suit. Today, the Li‑ion is the fastest growing and most promising battery chemistry.\nThe energy density of the Li‑ion is typically twice that of the standard NiCd. Improvements in electrode active materials have the potential of increasing the energy density close to three times that of the NiCd. In addition to high capacity, the load characteristics are reasonably good and behave similarly to the NiCd in terms of discharge characteristics (similar shape of discharge profile, but different voltage). The flat discharge curve offers effective utilization of the stored power in a desirable voltage spectrum.\nThe high cell voltage allows battery packs with only one cell. Most of today’s mobile phones run on a single cell, an advantage that simplifies battery design. To maintain the same power, higher currents are drawn. Low cell resistance is important to allow unrestricted current flow during load pulses.\nThe Li‑ion is a low maintenance battery, an advantage that most other chemistries cannot claim. There is no memory and no scheduled cycling is required to prolong the battery’s life. In addition, the self-discharge is less than half compared to NiCd, making the Li‑ion well suited for modern fuel gauge applications. Li‑ion cells cause little harm when disposed.\nDespite its overall advantages, Li‑ion also has its drawbacks. It is fragile and requires a protection circuit to maintain safe operation. Built into each pack, the protection circuit limits the peak voltage of each cell during charge and prevents the cell voltage from dropping too low on discharge. In addition, the cell temperature is monitored to prevent temperature extremes. The maximum charge and discharge current is limited to between 1C and 2C. With these precautions in place, the possibility of metallic lithium plating occurring due to overcharge is virtually eliminated.\nAging is a concern with most Li‑ion batteries and many manufacturers remain silent about this issue. Some capacity deterioration is noticeable after one year, whether the battery is in use or not. Over two or perhaps three years, the battery frequently fails. It should be noted that other chemistries also have age-related degenerative effects. This is especially true for the NiMH if exposed to high ambient temperatures.\nStoring the battery in a cool place slows down the aging process of the Li‑ion (and other chemistries). Manufacturers recommend storage temperatures of 15°C (59°F). In addition, the battery should be partially charged during storage.\nManufacturers are constantly improving the chemistry of the Li‑ion battery. New and enhanced chemical combinations are introduced every six months or so. With such rapid progress, it is difficult to assess how well the revised battery will age.\nThe most economical Li-ion battery in terms of cost-to-energy ratio is the cylindrical 18650 cell. This cell is used for mobile computing and other applications that do not demand ultra-thin geometry. If a slimmer pack is required (thinner than 18 mm), the prismatic Li‑ion cell is the best choice. There are no gains in energy density over the 18650, however, the cost of obtaining the same energy may double.\nFor ultra-slim geometry (less than 4 mm), the only choice is Li‑ion polymer. This is the most expensive system in terms of cost-to-energy ratio. There are no gains in energy density and the durability is inferior to the rugged 18560 cell.\nAdvantages and Limitations of Li-ion Batteries\nAdvantages\nHigh energy density — potential for yet higher capacities.\nRelatively low self-discharge — self-discharge is less than half that of NiCd and NiMH.\nLow Maintenance — no periodic discharge is needed; no memory.\nLimitations\nRequires protection circuit — protection circuit limits voltage and current. Battery is safe if not provoked.\nSubject to aging, even if not in use — storing the battery in a cool place and at 40 percent state-of-charge reduces the aging effect.\nModerate discharge current.\nSubject to transportation regulations — shipment of larger quantities of Li-ion batteries may be subject to regulatory control. This restriction does not apply to personal carry-on batteries.\nExpensive to manufacture — about 40 percent higher in cost than NiCd. Better manufacturing techniques and replacement of rare metals with lower cost alternatives will likely reduce the price.\nNot fully mature — changes in metal and chemical combinations affect battery test results, especially with some quick test methods.\nFigure 5: Advantages and limitations of Li-ion batteries\nThe Li-polymer differentiates itself from other battery systems in the type of electrolyte used. The original design, dating back to the 1970s, uses a dry solid polymer electrolyte. This electrolyte resembles a plastic-like film that does not conduct electricity but allows an exchange of ions (electrically charged atoms or groups of atoms). The polymer electrolyte replaces the traditional porous separator, which is soaked with electrolyte.\nThe dry polymer design offers simplifications with respect to fabrication, ruggedness, safety and thin-profile geometry. There is no danger of flammability because no liquid or gelled electrolyte is used. With a cell thickness measuring as little as one millimeter (0.039 inches), equipment designers are left to their own imagination in terms of form, shape and size.\nUnfortunately, the dry Li-polymer suffers from poor conductivity. Internal resistance is too high and cannot deliver the current bursts needed for modern communication devices and spinning up the hard drives of mobile computing equipment. Heating the cell to 60°C (140°F) and higher increases the conductivity but this requirement is unsuitable for portable applications.\nTo make a small Li-polymer battery conductive, some gelled electrolyte has been added. Most of the commercial Li-polymer batteries used today for mobile phones are a hybrid and contain gelled electrolyte. The correct term for this system is Lithium Ion Polymer. For promotional reasons, most battery manufacturers mark the battery simply as Li-polymer. Since the hybrid lithium polymer is the only functioning polymer battery for portable use today, we will focus on this chemistry.\nWith gelled electrolyte added, what then is the difference between classic Li‑ion and Li‑ion polymer? Although the characteristics and performance of the two systems are very similar, the Li‑ion polymer is unique in that solid electrolyte replaces the porous separator. The gelled electrolyte is simply added to enhance ion conductivity.\nTechnical difficulties and delays in volume manufacturing have deferred the introduction of the Li‑ion polymer battery. In addition, the promised superiority of the Li‑ion polymer has not yet been realized. No improvements in capacity gains are achieved — in fact, the capacity is slightly less than that of the standard Li‑ion battery. For the present, there is no cost advantage. The major reason for switching to the Li-ion polymer is form factor. It allows wafer-thin geometries, a style that is demanded by the highly competitive mobile phone industry.\nAdvantages and Limitations of Li-ion Polymer Batteries\nAdvantages\nVery low profile — batteries that resemble the profile of a credit card are feasible.\nFlexible form factor — manufacturers are not bound by standard cell formats. With high volume, any reasonable size can be produced economically.\nLight weight – gelled rather than liquid electrolytes enable simplified packaging, in some cases eliminating the metal shell.\nImproved safety — more resistant to overcharge; less chance for electrolyte leakage.\nLimitations\nLower energy density and decreased cycle count compared to Li-ion — potential for improvements exist.\nExpensive to manufacture — once mass-produced, the Li-ion polymer has the potential for lower cost. Reduced control circuit offsets higher manufacturing costs.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "A battery resembles a living organism that cannot be measured; only estimated by diagnostics similar to a doctor examining a patient. The accuracy of rapid-testing varies according to symptoms that change with state-of-charge (SoC), agitation after charge and discharge, temperature and storage. A well-functioning rapid-test must distinguish between a partially charged good battery and a fully charged weak pack. Both deliver similar momentary performance characteristics.\nThe leading health indicator of a battery is capacity. Capacity represents the energy storage, a quantity that gradually and permanently depletes with use. Other characteristics responsible for state-of-charge (SoH) are internal resistance (Ri) that governs load current and self-discharge that affects the mechanical integrity of a battery. On multi-cell packs, the balance of the cells connected in series and parallel should also be checked. (See BU-302: Series and Parallel Battery Configurations) These four characteristics should be met to give a battery a clean bill of health.\nThis article describes analog and digital battery test methods. Analog involves an electrical load to measure capacity as a function of time until the charge is depleted. The load also measures internal resistance (Ri) based on voltage drop.\nThe digital test method involves smart battery technology that assesses SoC and capacity by measuring in- and outflowing coulombs* (see BU-605 Testing and Calibrating Smart Batteries). With periodic calibration, smart batteries provide valuable SoH information on the fly. Here is a summary of analog and digital battery test methods.\nHere is a summary of simple to complex test methods to examine batteries.\nMeasures internal battery resistance to check loading characteristics and to identify fault conditions. This is done by AC or DC method; both provide different readings. (See BU-802a: How does Rising Internal Resistance affect Performance?\nand BU-902: How to Measure Internals Resistance) Resistance readings do not correlate with capacity.\nMost rapid-test methods are based on time domain or frequency domain analysis. Time domain excites the battery with pulses to observe ion-flow of Li-ion batteries. Frequency domain scans the battery with multiple frequencies to generate a Nyquist plot for analysis. Both methods require complex algorithms with parameters or matrices that serve as lookup tables.\nQuick-sort Model Specific (QSMS) observes the difference in resistive value when testing a battery with DC and AC methods. The algorithm is relatively simple and the test time is short, but each battery type requires a battery-specific parameter.\nElectrochemical Dynamic Response (EDR) measures the mobility of ion-flow between electrodes by applying load pulses and evaluating the response time on attack and recovery. The recovery times are compared with stored parameters relating to battery performance. (See BU-907: Testing Lithium-based Batteries) The diffusion coefficient of Li-ion differs according to active material and electrolyte additives used.\nElectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) injects AC signals at different frequencies to create a Nyquist plot. The Nyquist signature is superimposed onto electrochemical models that enable the estimation of capacity, CCA and SoC non-invasively. The typical test time is 15-60 seconds. (See BU-904: How to Measure Capacity)\nThe state of life indicator (SOLI) predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a battery by tracking delivered coulombs* as a percentage of total life expectancy revealed in Coulombic Energy Life (CEL).\nDefinition:\nCEL represents the energy of a fully charged battery multiplied by the cycle count the manufacturer specifies. CEL of a new battery is 100%, a level that gradually depletes with usage until the specified life expectancy is delivered. The process is analogous to a vehicle being replaced on the odometer reading.\nSOLI can be added in wheelchairs, computers-on-wheels, golf cars, floor cleanser and scissor lifts. Cloud analytics assess RUL for scheduled battery replacements.\n* One coulomb is equal to the amount of charge delivered by 1A of current in one second\nNo single test can capture all health characteristics of a battery. Many rapid-test devices look only at voltage and internal resistance. Stating the ability to estimate capacity with such methods makes industry believe that complex results are attainable with simplistic methods. Resistance-based instruments can indeed identify a dying; but so does the user.\nBattery results are affected by SoC levels, agitation and temperature. Cadex laboratories further discovered differences in how batteries are aged. What is most puzzling is why natural aging gives dissimilar results to stress testing in an environmental chamber.\nBattery testing always produces outliers that defy test protocols. Correct predictions for batteries in service should be 9 out of 10. Outliers may include batteries that are new and have not been fully formatted, or packs that have been in storage. Low SoC also causes errors.\nCapacity is the gate keeper of battery health that relates to runtime and predicts end-of-life. The term capacity is poorly understood. A battery is typically replaced when the capacity fades to 80 percent. Some applications allow a lower capacity threshold, and a starter battery should be replaced when the capacity falls below 40%. (See BU-504: How to Verify Sufficient Battery Capacity)\nWhen choosing the end-of-life threshold, an organization must ensure that the lowest performing battery delivers the expected runtime. Diagnostic Chargers and battery analyzers are becoming available that assess Minimal Operational Reserve (MOR), a verification standard that is governed by a user-adjustable Target Selector. Diagnostics enables the full use of each battery, reduces cost, improves system reliability and protects the environment.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-804a-corrosion-shedding-and-internal-short",
        "content": "Corrosion occurs primarily on the grid, and it is known as a “softening and shedding” of the lead off the plates. This reaction cannot be avoided because the electrodes in a lead acid environment are always reactive. Lead shedding is a natural phenomenon that can be reduced but not eliminated. A battery that reaches the end of life through this failure mode has met or exceeded the anticipated life span. Limiting the depth of discharge, reducing the cycle count, operating at a moderate temperature and controlling overcharge are preventive measures to keep corrosion in check.\nTo reduce corrosion on long-life batteries, manufacturers keep the specific gravity at a moderate 1.200 level when fully charged, compared to 1.265 and greater for high-performance lead acid batteries(See BU-903: How to measure State-of-charge) A lower specific gravity decreases the specific battery energy.\nApplying prolonged overcharge is another contributor to grid corrosion. This is especially damaging to sealed lead acid systems. While the flooded lead acid has some resiliency to overcharge, sealed units must operate at the recommended float charge(See BU-403: Charging Lead Acid)\nChargers with variable float voltages adjust the charge voltage to the prevailing temperature. Reducing the float charge when the ambient temperature reaches 29°C (85°F) and increasing it when colder lowers corrosion(See BU-410: Charging at High and Low Temperatures) Most chargers for stationary batteries feature temperature control, but this not common in vehicles. A fully charged starter battery is kept at 14.40V (2.40V/cell) while driving and this can lead to overcharge. The recommended float voltage is 13.60V (2.27V/cell).\nAs lead acid batteries are being replaced with Li-phosphate (LiFePO), precise charging is paramount. While the automotive charging system provides the correct end-of-charge voltage for LiFePO, Li-ion should receive no further charge when the battery is fully charged. With the LiFePO replacement, this does not happen and the starter battery receives continuous charge while cruising. Although LiFePO is more tolerant to overcharge than cobalt-blended Li-ion, overcharge can shorten the life of the Li-phosphate battery.\nTo attain maximum surface area, the lead on a starter battery is applied in a sponge-like form. With time and use, chunks of lead fall off and reduce the performance. Figure 1 illustrates the innards of a corroded lead acid battery.\nGrid corrosion is unavoidable because the electrodes in a lead acid environment are always reactive. Lead shedding is a natural phenomenon that can only be slowed and not eliminated.\nThe terminals of a battery can also corrode. This is often visible with the formation of white powder as a result of oxidation between two different metals connecting the poles. Terminal corrosion can eventually lead to an open electrical connection. Changing the connecting terminals to lead, the same material as the battery pole of a starter battery, will solve most corrosion problems.\nThe lead within a battery is mechanically active. On discharge, the lead sulfate causes the plates to expand, a movement that reverses during charge when the plates contract again. Over time, sulfite crystals form that cause shedding of lead material. The shedding in a starter battery is manageable because the battery does not go through a deep discharge, but this is a larger problem with a deep-cycle battery.\nElectrical short is another failure mode, especially with starter batteries in trucks. As the battery sheds its lead to the bottom of the container, a conductive layer forms that gradually fills the allotted space in the sediment trap. In time, the now conductive liquid may reach the plates, creating a shorting effect. The term “short” is a misnomer and elevated self-discharge or soft short would be better terms to describe this condition.\nSoft shorts are difficult to detect because the battery functions normally immediately after charge and everything seems fine. In essence, a charge wipes out all evidence of a soft short condition, except perhaps an elevated temperature during charge that may be noticed when touching the battery housing. However, once rested for 6–12 hours, the battery begins to show anomalies such as a lower open circuit voltage and reduced specific gravity.\nThe measured capacity will also be low because self-discharge has consumed some of the stored energy. According to the 2010 BCI Failure Mode Study, shorted batteries accounted for 18 percent of battery failures, a drop from 31 percent 5 years earlier. Improved manufacturing methods may account for this reduction.\nAnother form of soft short is mossing. This occurs when the separators and plates are slightly misaligned as a result of poor manufacturing practices and they cause parts of the plates to become naked. Such exposure promotes the formation of conductive crystal moss around the edges, which leads to elevated self-discharge.\nLead drop is another cause of short in which chunks of lead break loose from the welded bars connecting the plates. Unlike a soft short that develops with wear and tear, a lead drop often occurs early in battery life due to a manufacturing defect. This can lead to a serious electrical short with a permanent voltage drop that could result in thermal runaway.\nThe most radical and serious form of short is a mechanical failure in which the suspended plates become loose and touch each other. This results in a sudden high discharge current that can lead to excessive heat buildup and thermal runaway. Sloppy manufacturing as well as excessive shock and vibration are the most common contributors to this failure.\n[1] Source: Journal of Power Sources (2009)\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "The energy storage of a battery can be divided into three sections known as the available energy that can instantly be retrieved, the empty zone that can be refilled, and the unusable part, or rock content, that has become inactive as part of use and aging. Figure 1 illustrates these three sections.\nBatteries begin fading from the day they are manufactured. A new battery should deliver 100 percent capacity; most packs in use operate at less.\nAs the rock content portion of the battery grows, the charge time shortens because there is less to fill. Quicker charging times on faded batteries are noticeable especially with nickel-based batteries and in part also with lead acid, but not necessarily with Li-ion. Lower charge transfer capability that inhibits the flow of free electrons prolongs the charge time with aged Li-ion(See BU-409a: Why do Old Li-ion Batteries Take Long to Charge?)\nIn most cases, the decrease is linear and capacity fade is mostly a function of cycle count and age. A deep discharge stresses the battery more than a partial discharge. It is therefore better not to discharge the battery fully but charge it more often. A periodic full discharge is only recommended on nickel-based batteries to control “memory” and on smart batteries as part of calibration. Lithium- and nickel-based batteries deliver between 300 and 500 full discharge/charge cycles before the capacity drops below 80 percent.\nSpecifications of a device are always based on a new battery. This is only a snapshot, which cannot be maintained over any length of time. As with any shiny new machine, the battery will fade and if left unchecked, the reduced runtime can lead to battery-related breakdowns.\nA pack should be replaced when the capacity drops to 80 percent; however, the end-of-life threshold can vary according to application, user preference and company policy. Capacity measurement, a service that remains the best indicator for replacement, should be done every 3 months with active fleet batteries(See BU-909: Battery Test Equipment)\nBesides age-related losses, sulfation and grid corrosion are the main killers of lead acid batteries. Sulfation is a thin layer that forms on the negative cell plate if the battery is allowed to dwell in a low state-of-charge. If caught in time, an equalizing charge can reverse the condition. Grid corrosion can be reduced with careful charging and optimization of the float charge(See BU-403: Charging Lead Acid)\nWith nickel-based batteries, the rock content is often the result of crystalline formation, also known as “memory.” A full discharge/charge cycle often restores the battery to full service. A periodic full discharge while the battery is in service keeps the crystallization under control and prevents damage to the separator(See BU-807: How to Restore Nickel-based Batteries)\nThe aging process of lithium-ion is cell oxidation, a process that occurs naturally as part of usage and aging, and cannot be reversed(See BU-808b: What causes Li-ion to Die)\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "The smart battery was hailed as an engineering marvel when first introduced in 1994 by Intel and Duracell. Unlike a regular battery that is being charged by the algorithm of the charger, the smart battery becomes the host controlling the charge. The smart pack also provides state-of-charge (SoC), captures performance data and detects anomalies. To enable accurate data gathering, the smart battery needs periodic calibration to correct errors that occur with normal charge and discharge cycles.\nMost battery users have little patience for scheduled services and wait for the inevitable to happen that manifests in a gradual loss in accuracy of the internal fuel gauge. Meanwhile we drive EVs with a similar battery management system (BMS) that does not need calibration. Where does this leave us in terms of calibration?\nIn the absence of calibration, the device manufacturer advises the user to apply a periodic full discharge in the device to set the full discharge flag, followed by a full charge to set the full-charge flag. This establishes a linear line between a full and empty battery to read SoC. In time, the line gets blurred again with the need for a recalibration.\nSuch a calibration cycle does not address the fading capacity of the battery. A fully charged battery with a usable capacity of 50% will cut the runtime in half, reducing an hour to 30 minutes. Capacity is the leading health indicator that governs battery life.\nThe usable capacity in a SMBus battery is represented by Full Charge Capacity (FCC). When new, FCC is 100%. The number decreases as the battery ages.\nA modern Smart battery with impedance tracking periodically updates the usable capacity during normal use. Capacity updates occur when the fuel gauge is able to observe a significant change in SoC while measuring the energy flowing into or out of the battery. Impedance updates generally required a learning cycle.\nOur analogy illustrates a battery in the form of a glass with 20% unusable capacity, 30% old fill and a 30% measured new fill. Attaining a SoC of 80% enables the calculation of the usable capacity that is the sum of residual charge plus the energy added. The formula also applies in reverse by measuring the discharging energy.\nSoC is determined by measuring voltage and temperature when the battery is in a rested state in which the voltage has settled after agitation caused by charge and discharge. Internal tables store the relationship between SoC, voltage and temperature.\nThe modern smart battery updates its estimated capacity whenever it has the opportunity during charge or while being discharged for an undisturbed time, followed by a sufficiently long rest period to capture valid SoC readings by voltage. Best results are achieved by applying a deliberate full cycle with manufacturer’s specified learning algorithm, a service that can take 24 hours and can be done with a battery analyzer. Similar learning procedures are also recommended for the EV by allowing the vehicle to rest for a few hours at various SoC levels before charge. The smart battery is indeed smart but the reading can still be off by 10–20%.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-602-how-does-a-battery-fuel-gauge-work",
        "content": "The lifespan of a battery cannot be defined by the number of cycles or age alone but to a large extent by its usage (or misusage). As the capacity fades, the runtime gets shorter. The smart battery captures this capacity fade by reading the previous energy delivered, but these vital health statistics remain mostly hidden from the user. The battery continues to be a “black box” that conceals vital performance records and masks when the battery should be replaced.\nOne of the main tasks of the smart battery is to establish communication between the battery, charger and user. A fuel gauge indicating state-of-charge fulfills this in part. When pressing the TEST button on a fully charged SMBus battery, all signal lights illuminate. On a partially discharged battery, half the lights illuminate, and on an empty battery all lights remain dark or a red light appears. Figure 1 shows a fuel gauge of a battery that is 75 percent charged with three lights glowing.\nWhile the SoC information displayed on a battery or a display screen is helpful to the user, the readout does not guarantee the runtime. The fuel gauge resets to 100 percent with a full recharge regardless of how much capacity the battery can store.\nA serious breach of trust occurs if an aged battery shows 100 percent SoC while the battery’s ability to hold charge has dropped to 50 percent or less. We ask, “100 percent of what?” If, for example, 100 percent of a good battery results in a 4-hour runtime, a battery holding half the capacity would run for only 2 hours. Many users are unaware that the fuel gauge only shows SoC; capacity, the leading health indicator, remains unknown.\nOther than applying a controlled discharge, there is no reliable method to measure the capacity of “chemical battery” but there is a way to read the “digital battery.” The term chemical battery refers to the actual capacity derived by discharging a fully charged pack, whereas the digital battery is a peripheral monitoring circuit that stores the estimated capacity derived by coulomb counting when charging and discharging a battery as part of field use.\nThe SMBus battery stores the factory-set design capacity in Ah or 100 percent by default. With each full charge, the battery resets the full-charge flag and during discharge, the coulomb counter measures the energy consumed. The in-and-out-flowing coulombs can be used to estimate battery state-of-health known as full charge capacity (FCC). As the battery fades with usage and time, so also does the delivered energy decrease, and the FCC number will decline. The FCC accuracy of a battery that is being deep cycled is about +/-5 percent compared to capacity readings taken by discharging. Periodic calibration will improve the FCC accuracy.\nCapacity can also be estimated by coulomb counting during charging. This works best with an empty battery. A battery with a 100 percent capacity will receive the full coulomb count; one with only 50 percent capacity will only accept half before the battery reaches full charge. Not knowing the residual SoC when the coulomb count begins will affect the accuracy. SoC can be estimated by measuring the battery’s open circuit voltage (OCV), but this only gives a rough approximation as agitation after charge or discharge, as well as temperature, affects the OCV.\nThe SoC and capacity information can be shown on a linear display using colored LEDs. The green lights indicate the usable capacity; the empty part of the battery is marked with un-lit LEDs; and the unusable part is shown with red LEDs. Figure 2 illustrates a tri-state fuel gauge. The results can also be shown on a digital display.\nThe tri-state fuel gauge reads the “learned” battery information on the SMBus and displays it on a multi colored LED bar. The illustration shows a partially discharged battery of 50% SoC with 20% empty and 30% unusable.\nThe tri-state fuel gauge provides state-of-function (SoF), the ultimate in battery diagnostics. Some device manufacturers are hesitant to offer this feature to consumers because this could lead to elevated warranty claims. A replacement only becomes mandatory if the battery capacity drops below 80 percent; keeping the evidence hidden is seen as the least disruptive method. SoF can always be accessed by a service code. SoF works best for industrial uses.\nVehicles with electric propulsion do not show the charge but only the remaining driving range, thus hiding the capacity. To accommodate capacity fade that would shorten the driving range, the EV battery is being oversized and does not fully charge and discharge when new. Only as the battery ages and the capacity fades does the charging range gradually increase. Shorter driving ranges only become apparent once this grace buffer has been consumed.

        "content": "Considering the importance which the battery holds in modern life, improvements have been slow in coming when compared to the advancements made in microelectronics. Let us not point the finger at laid-back scientists and engineers but realize the complexity encountered. As long as the battery relies on the electrochemical process, limitations will continue. These are low energy storage, slow charging, short service life and high cost per watt.\nEach battery system offers distinct advantages but none provides a fully satisfactory solution. For many years, nickel-based batteries delivered reasonably good service, but this chemistry is being superseded with lithium-ion offering higher specific energy (capacity), lower self-discharge and no maintenance. Lead acid with its many warts and blemishes still holds a solid position and will continue to keep its lead as starter and deep-cycle battery. No other system can meet the price and robustness on bulk power.\nNever has there been so much activity in battery research and the electric vehicle (EV) is the catalyst for this frenzy. Expectations are high and the media is quick to announce a new battery that promises long runtime, good durability and is environmental friendly. Indeed, some systems show good potential, but most are years away from becoming commercially viable. Many disappear without a trace of the passing.\nTypical failings of new battery concepts are weak load capabilities and short cycle life. Even a lemon can be made into a battery. Just poke a copper coin and galvanized nail into the innards. The power is low, and 500 lemons can light a flashlight bulb. Using seawater as an electrolyte has also been tried. The sea would produce an endless supply of electricity, but the retrieved energy is only good to light a flashlight. Corrosion of the plates limits the useful service life and renders the seawater battery impracticable.\nWith the interest in battery developments at an all-time high, it is only fitting that we review old and up-and-coming systems. The chemistries listed below are placed in roughly the sequence of development. Many older batteries are being revised to offer longer lives, extended runtimes and better pricing.\nAfter inventing nickel-cadmium in 1899, Sweden’s Waldemar Jungner tried to use iron instead of cadmium to save money, but poor charge efficiency and gassing prompted him to abandon the project without securing a patent. In 1901, Thomas Edison continued the development as an alternative to lead acid for the electric vehicles, claiming superior performance. He lost out when gasoline-powered cars took over and was deeply disappointed when the auto industry chose lead acid as the starter battery.\nThe nickel-iron battery (NiFe) uses an oxide-hydroxide cathode and an iron anode with potassium hydroxide electrolyte to produce a nominal cell voltage of 1.2V. NiFe is resilient to overcharge and over-discharge and can last for more than 20 years in standby applications. Resistance to vibrations and high temperatures made NiFe the preferred battery for mining in Europe, and during World War II powered the German V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rockets. Other applications are railroad signaling, forklifts, and stationary applications. NiFe has a low specific energy of about 50Wh/kg, has poor low-temperature performance and exhibits high self-discharge of 20 to 40 percent a month. These disadvantages together with high manufacturing cost prompted the industry to stay faithful to lead acid.\nNickel-zinc (NiZn) batteries are similar to nickel-cadmium in that they use an alkaline electrolyte and a nickel electrode, but differ in voltage; NiZn provides 1.6V/cell rather than 1.2V, which NiCd delivers. Nickel-zinc was first developed in the 1920s but it suffered from short cycle life caused by dendrite growth and electrical shorting. Improvements in the electrolyte reduced this problem. Low cost, high power output and good temperature operating range make this chemistry attractive, and NiZn is being revived for commercial uses. NiZn charges at a constant current to 1.9V/cell, but cannot take trickle charge. The specific energy is similar to other nickel-based systems. NiZn is good for 200–300 full cycles, has no heavy toxic materials and can be recycled. The battery is also available in AA cells.\nWhen research for nickel-metal-hydride began in 1967, problems with metal instabilities shifted the development towards the nickel-hydrogenbattery (NiH). NiH uses a steel canister to store the hydrogen gases at a pressure of 1,200psi (8,270kPa). The cell includes solid nickel electrodes, hydrogen electrodes, gas screens and electrolyte that are encapsulated in the pressurized vessel.\nNiH has a nominal cell voltage of 1.25V and the specific energy is 40–75Wh/kg. The advantages are long service life even with full discharge cycles, good calendar life due to low corrosion, minimal self-discharge, and a remarkable temperature performance of –28°C to 54°C (–20°F to 130°F). These attributes make NiH ideal for satellite use. Scientists are developing NiH batteries for terrestrial use and hope to supply markets for energy storage systems and the electric vehicle. The negatives are low specific energy and high cost. A single cell for a satellite costs thousands of dollars.\nZinc-air batteries generate electrical power by an oxidation process of zinc and oxygen from the air. The cell can produce 1.65V, but 1.4V and lower achieves a longer lifetime. Removing a sealing tab activates the battery by enabling airflow and the battery reaches full operating voltage within five seconds. Once turned on, the battery cannot be stopped. Inhibiting airflow by adding a tape only slows degeneration.\nZinc-air batteries have similarities to the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) by using oxygen in the air as fuel for the positive electrode. Air can, to a certain extent, control the rate of the reaction. Zinc-air is considered a primary battery; however, there are recharging versions for high-power applications. Recharging occurs by replacing the spent zinc electrodes, which can be in the form of a zinc electrolyte paste. A different type of zinc-air battery uses zinc pellets. Rechargeable zinc-air batteries have been tried on electric vehicles and discontinued.\nAt 300–400Wh/kg, zinc-air has a high specific energy, manufacturing cost is moderate, but the specific power (current handling) is low. In a sealed state, the self-discharge is two percent per year. Zinc-air is sensitive to extreme temperatures and high humidity. Pollution also affects performance; high ambient carbon dioxide reduces the performance by increasing the internal resistance. Typical applications are hearing aids and safety lamps at construction sites.\nThe silver-zinc battery served as an important power source in defense, aerospace, high-end TV cameras and other professional equipment that needed long runtime. High cost, short service life and the advent of Li-ion caused silver-zing to lose favor.\nRapid degradation of the zinc electrode and separator were the primary cause of failure in the original design. During cycling, the buildup of zinc dendrites pierced the separator and caused electrical shorts. Furthermore, the separator degraded by itself sitting in the potassium hydroxide electrolyte. This limits the shelf-life to about two years. Improvements in the zinc electrode and separator promise a longer service life and a 40 percent higher specific energy than Li-ion. Silver-zinc is safe, has no toxic metals and can be recycled, but the use of silver makes the battery expensive to manufacture.\nSodium batteries, also known as molten salt or thermal battery, come in primary and secondary versions. The battery uses molten salts as an electrolyte and operates at a temperature of 400–700°C (752–1,292°F). Newer designs run at a lower 245–350°C (473–662°F) temperature.\nConceived by the Germans during World War II and used in their V-2 rockets, the electrolyte of the molten salt batteries is inactive when cold and can be stored for more than 50 years. Once activated with a heat source, the battery can provide a high power burst for a fraction of a second or deliver energy over several hours. High power is made possible with good ionic conductivity of the molten salt. Primary sodium batteries are almost exclusively used for the military as a “one-shot” engagement in guided missiles; however, the interest lies in the rechargeable version.\nThe modern rechargeable sodium-sulfur is known as sodium-nickel-chloride battery or ZEBRA, so-called after the Zeolite Battery Research Africa project. The battery has a nominal cell voltage of 2.58 volts and a specific energy of 90–120Wh/kg, a level comparable with Li-manganese and Li-phosphate. The service life is about eight years and 3,000 cycles. It can be fast-charged, is non-toxic and the raw materials are abundant and at low-cost. ZEBRA batteries come in large sizes of 10kWh or higher. Typical applications are forklifts, railways, ships, submarines and electric cars in continuous use such as taxis and delivery vans. A growing market for sodium-based batteries is load leveling, also known as grid storage.\nThe ZEBRA battery must be heated to 270–350°C (518–662°F). Even with special insulation, heating consumes 14 percent of the battery’s energy per day, which results in the equivalent of an 18 percent self-discharge. A ZEBRA battery should be either on charge or in use. It takes 3–4 days to cool down; reheating requires about two days depending on the SoC at time of shutdown. Common failures are electrical shorts due to corrosion and dendrite growth, which increases self-discharge.\nExperimental batteries live in laboratories and connect to the outside world through glowing reports, mostly to entice investors. It is our hope that these developments will one day mature into a battery that does more than talking on cell phone; the goal is to achieve environmental benefit for automotive transportation. There are no immediate candidates that could disrupt present battery chemistries, but the potential is there. Below are the most promising experimental batteries worth mentioning.\nMost lithium-metal batteries are non-rechargeable. Moli Energy of Vancouver was first to mass-produce a rechargeable Li-metal battery for mobile phones, but occasional shorts from lithium dendrites caused thermal runaway conditions and the batteries were recalled in 1989. Li-metal has a high specific energy. In 2010, a trial Li-metal-polymer with a capacity of 300Wh/kg was tested in an experimental electric vehicle (this compares to 80Wh/kg for the Nissan Leaf), but safety remains a major issue.\nLi-air batteries borrow the idea from zinc-air and the fuel cell in that they breathe air. The battery uses a catalytic air cathode that supplies oxygen, as well as a lithium anode and electrolyte. Scientists anticipate an energy storage potential that is 5 to 10 times larger than that of Li-ion but say it will take one to two decades before the technology can be commercialized. Depending on materials used, Li-ion-air will produce voltages in between 1.7 and 3.2V/cell. IBM, Excellatron, Liox Power, Lithion-Yardney, Poly Plus, Rayovac and others are developing the technology. The theoretical specific energy of lithium-air is 13kWh/kg; aluminum-air has similar qualities, with an 8kWh/kg theoretical specific energy.\nBy virtue of the low atomic weight of lithium and the moderate weight of sulfur, lithium-sulfur batteries offer a very high specific energy of 550Wh/kg, about three times that of Li-ion, and a specific power potential of 2,500Wh/kg. During discharge, the lithium dissolves from the anode surface, and reverses itself when charging by plating itself back onto the anode. Li-S has good cold temperature discharge characteristics and can be recharged at –60°C (–76°F). The challenges are limited cycle life of only 40 to 50 charges/discharges and instabilities at high temperature. Since 2007, Stanford engineers get promising results experimenting nanowire. Li-S has a cell voltage of 2.10V and is environmentally friendly. Sulfur as the main ingredient is abundantly available.\nUnlike carbon as the typical anode material in the regular lithium-ion battery, researchers have developed silicon-carbon nanocomposite. This promotes the access of lithium ions to achieve stable performance and a capacity gain of five times that of regular Li-ion. Manufacturing is said to be simple and low-cost, and the battery is safe; however, the cycle life is limited due to structural problems when inserting and extracting lithium-ion at high volume.\nDuring the last five years or so, no new battery emerged that could be called a major breakthrough. This is not surprising when considering that few other products have requirements as stringent as the battery. A battery must have high energy storage capability, provide a long service life, be safe to use, and require little maintenance. In addition, the battery must work at hot and cold temperatures, deliver high power on demand, charge quickly, and cost little. As we expand the use of the battery in transportation, it becomes apparent that this electrochemical power source is best suited for portable use. For motive applications such as trains, ocean going ships and aircraft, the battery lacks capacity, endurance and reliability. The dividing line, in my opinion, will be the electric vehicle.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "When studying the characteristics relating to battery state-of-health (SoH) and state-of-charge (SoC), some interesting and disturbing effects can be observed - the properties are cumbersome and not linear. Worst of all, the parameters are unique for every battery type. This inherent complexity makes it difficult to create a formula for rapid testing that works for all batteries. In spite of these seemingly insurmountable odds, battery rapid testing is possible. But the questions are asked, how accurate will the test results be and how will the system adapt to different battery types. Instrument cost and ease-of-use are also concerns. This paper evaluates currently used methods, which include the load test, AC conductance test and the six-point test developed by Cadex.\nThe load test provides important battery information consisting of open battery voltage, voltage under load and internal resistance. nickel-based batteries should always indicate an open terminal voltage of about 1.1V/cell, even if empty. The electro-chemical reaction of the different metals in the cell generates this voltage potential. A depressed voltage may indicate high self-discharge or a partial electrical short. A lead-based battery must always have a charge and the open terminal voltage should read 2.0V/cell and higher. If below 2 volts, a sulfation layer builds up that makes a recharge difficult, if impossible. An open terminal voltage of 2.10V/cell indicates that the battery is roughly 50% charged. The voltage of a lithium-based battery can, to some extent, indicate SoC. A fully charged cell reads about 4.0V/cell and a partially charged cell measures between 3.0 and 4.0V/cell. The load test applies a momentary load, during which the voltage is measured. Voltage over current equals the resistance. More accurate results are obtained by applying a two-stage load. Figure 1 illustrates the voltage pattern of such a two-stage load test.\nAn alternative method of measuring the internal battery resistance is the AC conductance test. An alternating current of 50 to 1000 Hertz is applied to the battery terminals. The battery's reactance causes a phase shift between voltage and current, which reveals the condition of the battery. AC conductance works best on single cells. Figure 2 demonstrates the relation of voltage and current on a battery.\nFigure 2: AC load test. The AC method measures the phase shift between voltage and current. The battery's reactance and/or voltage deflections are used to calculate the impedance.Some AC resistance meters evaluate only the load factor and disregard the phase shift information. This technique behaves similar to the pulse method in that the AC voltage is superimposed on the battery's DC voltage and acts as brief charge and discharge pulses. The amplitude of the ripple is utilized to calculate the internal battery resistance. There are some discrepancies in the resistance readings between the 'load test' and 'AC conductance test'. The differences are more apparent on marginal than on good batteries. So which reading is correct? In many aspects, the AC conductance is superior to the load test, however, one single frequency cannot provide enough data to evaluate the battery adequately. Multi-frequency devices are being developed but their complexity rises exponentially with the number of frequencies used. Resistance measurement, as a whole, provides only a rough sketch of the battery's performance because various battery conditions affect the readings. For example, a battery that has just been charged shows a higher resistance reading than one that has rested for a few hours. An empty or nearly empty battery also exhibits elevated internal resistance. To obtain reliable readings, a battery must be at least 50% charged. Temperature further affects the internal resistance readings. A hot battery reads a lower resistance than one at ambient temperature or one that is cold. In addition, the chemistry, the number of cells connected in series and the current rating (size in mAh) of a battery influence the results. Many batteries also contain a protection circuit that further distorts the readings.\nCadex Electronics has developed a method to measure the state-of-health (SoH) of a battery in 3 minutes. QuickTest™ uses a patent-pending inference algorithm to fuse data from 6 variables, which are: capacity, internal resistance, self-discharge, charge acceptance, discharge capabilities and mobility of electrolyte. The data is combined with a trend-learning algorithm to provide an accurate SoH reading in percent. Figure 3 illustrates general structure of such a network.\nQuickTest™ is built into the Cadex C7000-Series battery analyzers and services nickel, lithium and lead-based batteries for two-way radios, cell phones, laptops, scanners and medical devices. The analyzers are user-programmable and also perform battery priming, reconditioning, fast-charging, life-testing and boosting functions. QuickTest™ uses battery specific matrices that are obtained with the analyzer's trend learning process. The ability to learn allows adapting to new batteries in the field. The matrices are stored in the battery adapters and automatically configure the analyzer to the correct battery setting. The adapters commonly include the matrix at time of purchase. If missing, the matrix can be added in the field by scanning two or more batteries on the analyzer's Learn program. The required charge level to perform QuickTest™ is 20-90%. If outside this range, the analyzer automatically applies a brief charge or discharge.What is the definition of state-of-health and when should a battery be replaced? SoH reveals the overall battery conditions based on the above mentioned variables, which are capacity, internal resistance, self-discharge, charge acceptance, discharge capabilities and mobility of electrolyte. If any of these variables provide marginal readings, the end result will be affected. A battery may have a good capacity but the internal resistance is high. In this case, the end SoH reading will be lowered accordingly. Similar demerit points are added if the battery has high self-discharge or exhibits other chemical deficiencies. The battery should be replaced if the SoH falls below 80%.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-907b-advancements-in-battery-testing",
        "content": "Battery testing is the product of electrochemical evidence and data analysis with artificial intelligence. A battery cannot be “measured,” only estimated by analyzing its symptoms. These symptoms change with state-of-charge (SoC), temperature, agitation, storage and age. As an example, a good battery with low charge performs similar to a weak battery that is fully charged. Modern test methods must identify these conditions. Figure 1 summarized current SoH test methods organized into five categories.\nApplying pulses measures the internal resistance (Ri) of a battery. Differences between pulse duration and depth of discharge reveal unique performance characteristics. However, capacity assessment is not possible as Ri does not correlate reliably with capacity.\nDynamic Electrochemical Response (DER) checks ion-flow in Li-ion batteries to examine the dynamic behavior relating to battery health (SoH). DER tests a broad range of batteries by profiling a model-specific battery.\nEIS applies a sinusoidal signal from 2KHz to 100mHz, followed by filtering and magnitude extraction. Modelling and statistical analysis occurs by fitting Nyquist plots with matrices derived from same-type batteries but different SoH. Data fusion correlates values of key parameters to measure capacity, Cold Cranking Amp (CCA), State-of-Charge (SoC) and other readings.\nScientists believe that future battery diagnostics lies in Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Cadex was first to test batteries with EIS under the Spectro™ trademark, incorporated in Spectro™ devices to test lead acid and Li-ion chemistries from 3V to 60V with capacities up to 250Ah. Ri must be above 500 micro-ohms Figure 3 illustrates the mechanics. See also see BU-904.\nSeveral algorithmic methods can be used to measure battery SoH with EIS.\nIn some applications, fuzzy logic is superseded with other methods that provide solid results with low-level training data.\nANN relies on big data to provide a classified output using artificial neural network. The connecting units with hidden layers are called neurons. They form a biological brain that simulates animal instinct. Correct prediction is mostly determined by the number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each hidden layer, activation function, optimizer learning rate and training epochs. One might say: “Garbage in; garbage out,” but the Data-driven method produces reliable results with known user-patterns. Figure 5 demonstrates a typical Artificial Neural Network.\nModel-specific parameters are trained with machine-learning to measure battery SoH by the Bayesian approach. GPR offers superior results with fewer training data than ANN. Cadex labs achieves accuracies of 90% with lead acid batteries, findings that are being verified by scientists at UBC. The tests repeated with Li-ion systems are getting promising results. The Gaussian Process Regression as illustrated in Figure 6 is a promising variant.\nCadex labs study other methods to assess battery SoH with the results shown in Table 7. With a pool of 800 lead acid test batteries with various SoH, Gaussian Process, Neural Net and Fuzzy Logic are of interest. Other methods reflect lower accuracies when testing bad batteries.\nDefinition: Good Batteries have a reading above 40% capacity; Poor Batteries are below 40%. 40% is the common pass/fail threshold of starter batteries.\nCadex is experimenting with proprietary algorithms that will gain further improvements over the results shown in this paper using multi-model EIS to study the kinetic reactions of batteries at various SoH conditions. The goal is to create robust matrices with the least number of sample batteries serving as training.\nThe parser estimates the usable battery capacity by reading state-of-charge with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and counting coulombs to fill the available space to reach full charge. The usable capacity is the sum of the measured SoC plus the energy added. For best result, each battery should undergo a one-time calibration by cycling a good pack. In addition, the battery must be sufficiently discharged to attain accurate readings. A “charge runway” from 40% to 100% provides accurate value in assessing the usable capacity.\nNot all batteries are fully charged when tested. Combining EIS with the Kalman Filter improves the accuracy when testing a battery at low SoC. Identifying a good battery at low charge is of special interest for car makers to reduce warranty claims. Figure 8 illustrates how large fluctuations are being levelled under controlled usage.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-304a: Safety Concerns with Li-ion",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-304a-safety-concerns-with-li-ion",
        "content": "Safety of lithium-based batteries has attracted much media and legal attention. Any energy storage device carries a risk, as demonstrated in the 1800s when steam engines exploded and people got hurt. Carrying highly flammable gasoline in cars was a hot topic in the early 1900s. All batteries carry a safety risk, and battery makers are obligated to meet safety requirements; less reputable firms are known to make shortcuts and it’s “buyer beware!”\nLithium-ion is safe but with millions of consumers using batteries, failures are bound to happen. In 2006, a one-in-200,000 breakdown triggered a recall of almost six million lithium-ion packs. Sony, the maker of the lithium-ion cells in question, points out that on rare occasion microscopic metal particles may come into contact with other parts of the battery cell, leading to a short circuit within the cell.\nBattery manufacturers strive to minimize the presence of metallic particles. The semiconductor industry has spent billions of dollars to find ways in reducing particles that reduce the yield in wafers. Advanced cleanrooms are Class 10 in which 10,000 particles larger than 0.1µm per cubic meter are present (ISO 4 under ISO 14644 and ISO 14698). In spite of this high cleanliness, particle defects still occur in semiconductor wafers. Class 10 reduces the particles count but does not fully eliminate them.\nBattery manufacturers may use less stringently controlled cleanrooms than the semiconductor industry. While a non-functioning semiconductor simply ends up in the garbage bin, a compromised Li-ion can make its way into the workforce undetected and deteriorate without knowing. Resulting failures are especially critical with the thinning of the separators to increase the specific energy.\nCells with ultra-thin separators of 24µm or less (24-thousandth of an mm) are more susceptible to impurities than the older designs with lower Ah ratings. Whereas the 1,350 mAh cell in the 18650 package could tolerate a nail penetration test, the high-density 3,400 mAh can ignite when performing the same test. (See BU-306: What is the Function of the Separator?) New safety standards direct how batteries are used, and the UL1642 Underwriters Laboratories (UL) test no longer mandates nail penetration for safety acceptance of lithium-based batteries.\nTo verify the safety of a new cell, a manufacturer may release 1 million samples into a workforce on observation. The cell is approved for the use of critical missions, such as medical, if no failure occurs in one year that could compromise safety. Similar field-testing is also common with pharmaceutical products.\nLi-ion using conventional metal oxides is nearing its theoretical limit on specific energy. Rather than optimizing capacity, battery makers are improving manufacturing methods to enhance safety and increase calendar life. The real problem lies when on rare occasions an electrical short develops inside the cell. The external protection peripherals are ineffective to stop a thermal runaway once in progress. The batteries recalled in 2006 had passed the UL safety requirements — yet they failed under normal use with appropriate protection circuits.\nThere are two basic types of battery failures. One occurs at a predictable interval-per-million and is connected with a design flaw involving the electrode, separator, electrolyte or processes. These defects often involve a recall to correct a discovered flaw. The more difficult failures are random events that do not point to a design flaw. It may be a stress event like charging at sub-freezing temperature, vibration, or a fluke incident that is comparable to being hit by a meteor.\nLet’s examine the inner workings of the cell more closely. A mild short will only cause elevated self-discharge and the heat buildup is minimal because the discharging power is very low. If enough microscopic metallic particles converge on one spot, a sizable current begins to flow between the electrodes of the cell, and the spot heats up and weakens. As a small water leak in a faulty hydro dam can develop into a torrent and take a structure down, so too can heat buildup damage the insulation layer in a cell and cause an electrical short. The temperature can quickly reach 500°C (932°F), at which point the cell catches fire or it explodes. This thermal runaway that occurs is known as “venting with flame.” “Rapid disassembly” is the preferred term by the battery industry.\nUneven separators can also trigger cell failure. Poor conductivity due to dry areas increases the resistance, which can generate local heat spots that weaken the integrity of the separator. Heat is always an enemy of the battery.\nMost major Li-ion cell manufacturer x-ray every single cell as part of automated quality control. Software examines anomalies such as bent tabs or crushed jelly rolls. This is the reason why Li-ion batteries are so safe today, but such careful manufacturing practices may only be offered with recognized brands.\nQuality lithium-ion batteries are safe if used as intended. However, a high number of heat and fire failures had been reported in consumer products that use non-certified batteries, and the hoverboard is an example. This may have been solved with the use of certified Li-ion on most current models. A UL official at a meeting in the Washington, D.C. area said that no new incident of overheating or fire had been reported since Li-ion in hoverboards was certified. Fires originating in the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 were due to a manufacturing defect that had been solved. The main-ship battery in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner also had defects that were resolved.\nIncorrect uses of all batteries are excessive vibration, elevated heat and charging Li-ion below freezing. (See BU-410: Charging at High and Low Temperature) Li-ion and lead acid batteries cannot be fully discharged and must be stored with a remaining charge. While nickel-based batteries can be stored in a fully discharged state with no apparent side effect, Li-ion must not dip below 2V/cell for any length of time. Copper shunts form inside the cells that can lead to elevated self-discharge or a partial electrical short. If recharged, the cells might become unstable, causing excessive heat or showing other anomalies.\nHeat combined with a full charge is said to induce more stress to Li-ion than regular cycling. Keep the battery and a device away from sun exposure and store in a cool place at a partial charge. Exceeding the recommended charge current by ultra-fast changing also harms Li-ion. Nickel-cadmium is the only chemistry that accepts ultra-fast charging with minimal stress. (See BU-401a: Fast and Ultra-fast Chargers)\nLi-ion batteries that have been exposed to stresses may function normally but they become more sensitive to mechanical abuse. The liability for a failed battery goes to the manufacturer even if the fault may have been caused by improper use and handling. This worries the battery manufacturers and they go the extra mile to make their products safe. Treat the battery as if it were a living organism by preventing excess stress.\nWith more than a billion mobile phones and computers used in the world every day, the number of accidents is small. By comparison, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say that your chance of being struck by lightning in the course of a lifetime is about 1 in 13,000. Lithium-ion batteries have a failure rate that is less than one in a million. The failure rate of a quality Li-ion cell is better than 1 in 10 million.\nIndustrial batteries, such as those used for power tools, are generally more rugged than those in consumer products. Besides solid construction, power tool batteries are maximized for power delivery and less on energy for long runtimes. Power Cells have a lower Ah rating than Energy Cells and are in general more tolerant and safer if abused.\nBattery Safety in Public addresses concerns with consumer batteries. One of the most accident-prone batteries is Li-ion in an 18650 cell with an unfamiliar brand name. These batteries made available for vaping do not have the same quality and safety as a recognized brand name. Li-ion is safe if made by a reputable manufacturer, but there have been a number fires and injuries with cells that developed defects and caught fire while carrying in clothing and while traveling. An onboard fire forced a WestJet plane to return to the airport in 2018 soon after takeoff. The burning e-cigarette battery was illegally placed in baggage as spare and checked in. The plane’s cargo bay is not accessible when in flight and a burning battery requires an unscheduled landing. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recorded 206 incidents involving Li-ion batteries between 1991 and 2018.\nIf a Li-ion battery overheats, hisses or bulges, immediately move the device away from flammable materials and place it on a non-combustible surface. If at all possible, remove the battery and put it outdoors to burn out. Simply disconnecting the battery from charge may not stop its destructive path.\nA small Li-ion fire can be handled like any other combustible fire. For best result use a foam extinguisher, CO2, ABC dry chemical, powdered graphite, copper powder or soda (sodium carbonate). If the fire occurs in an airplane cabin, the FAA instructs flight attendants to use water or soda pop. Water-based products are most readily available and are appropriate since Li-ion contains very little lithium metal that reacts with water. Water also cools the adjacent area and prevents the fire from spreading. Research laboratories and factories also use water to extinguish Li-ion battery fires.\nCrew can’t access the cargo areas of a passenger aircraft during flight. To assure safety in case of a fire, planes rely on fire suppression systems. Halon is a common fire suppressant, but this agent may not be sufficient to extinguish a Li-ion fire in the cargo bay. FAA tests found that the anti-fire halon gas installed in airline cargo areas can’t extinguish a battery fire that combines with other highly flammable material, such as the gas in an aerosol can or cosmetics commonly carried by travelers. However, the system prevents the blaze from spreading to adjacent flammable material such as cardboard or clothing.\nWith the increased use of Li-ion batteries, improved methods to extinguish lithium fires have been developed. The Aqueous Vermiculite Dispersion (AVD) fire extinguishing agent disperses chemically exfoliated vermiculite in the form of a mist that provides advantages over existing products. AVD fire extinguishers are available in a 400ml aerosol can for a small fire; AVD canister for warehouses and factories; a 50 liter AVD trolley system for larger fires, and a modular system that can be carried on a pickup truck.\nExtover® is another fire extinguishing medium that effectively suppresses and smothers burning Li-ion batteries to minimize damage to the surrounding area through isolation of the fire source. The lightweight and free-flowing glass aggregate can be applied to a burning battery by hand, bucket, or shovel. Grain sizes vary from 0.04mm to 2mm to suit different applications. Extover® allows the battery to safely burn out with a homogenous covering because a flaming Li-ion battery cannot be easily extinguished. Extover® does not contain chemical agents, is made from 100% post-consumer recycled content, and is suitable for small and large batteries. The material can be reused if clean.\nA readily-available and effective fire retardant is sand kept in a fire-proof bucked. In case of fire, the flaming battery is moved into the bucked and covered with sand to allow a controlled burn-out. The sand can also be heaved over the hot battery to prevent the fire from spreading. Sand is about three-times heavier than Extover® made from post-consumer glass.\nA large Li-ion fire, such as in an EV, may need to burn out. Water with copper material can be used, but this may not be available and is costly for fire halls. Increasingly, experts advise using water even with large Li-ion fires. Water lowers combustion temperature but is not recommended for battery fires containing lithium-metal.\nResearch by IdTechEx reveals that 17% of EV fires occur during regular driving; 25% when charging; 20% in a crash; and 4% when unduly exposes the battery to air or water. The report says EV fires are more severe than with conventional ICE vehicles. A Tesla Model S fire required nearly 30,000 gallons (over 100,000 liters) of water to extinguish the fire due to reigniting and continuously burning for four hours. By comparison, a typical car fire with ICE engine can be extinguished with about 300 gallons (>1,000 liters) of water. Remedies to EV fires are often software changes to lower the battery capacity to 90%. There have also been rare manufacturing defects in cells. IDTechEx expects tighter regulations in design with the use of more fire-retardant materials.\nWhen encountering a fire with a lithium-metal battery, only use a Class D fire extinguisher. Lithium-metal contains plenty of lithium that reacts with water and makes the fire worse. As the number of EVs grows, so must the methods to extinguish such fires.\nDuring a thermal runaway, the high heat of the failing cell inside a battery pack may propagate to the next cells, causing them to become thermally unstable also. A chain reaction can occur in which each cell disintegrates on its own timetable. A pack can thus be destroyed in a few seconds or over several hours as each cell is being consumed. To increase safety, packs should include dividers to protect the failing cell from spreading to the neighboring one. Figure 1 shows a laptop that was damaged by a faulty Li-ion battery.\nThe gas released by a venting Li-ion cell is mainly carbon dioxide (CO2). Other gases that form through heating are vaporized electrolyte consisting of hydrogen fluoride (HF) from 20–200mg/Wh, and phosphoryl fluoride (POF3) from 15–22mg/Wh. Burning gases also include combustion products and organic solvents.\nThe knowledge on the toxicity of burning electrolyte is limited and toxicity can be higher than with regular combustibles. Ventilate the room and vacate area if smoke and gases are present. Gas and smoke in a confined area such as an aircraft, submarine and mine shaft will present a potential health risk.\nWhile lithium-based batteries are heavily studied for safety, nickel- and lead-based batteries also cause fires and are being recalled. The reasons are faulty separators resulting from aging, rough handling, excessive vibration and high-temperature. Lithium-ion batteries have become very safe and heat-related failures occur rarely when used correctly.\n[1] Source: Shmuel De-Leon\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "In the search for low-cost batteries, consumers may inadvertently purchase counterfeit batteries that are unsafe. The battery label appears bona fide and the buyer often cannot distinguish between an original and a forged product. Mobile phone manufacturers are concerned about these products flooding the market and advise customers to only use approved brands; defiance could void the warranty. Manufacturers do not object to third-party suppliers as long as the aftermarket batteries are well built, safe and approved by a safety agency.\nConsumers are not the only buyers leaning towards aftermarket batteries. Public safety, healthcare and other organizations also take advantage of economically priced replacement batteries. Industrial aftermarket batteries are normally prequalified and many perform well, but the quality can be less consistent than the brand-name product, and some packs are said to be underperforming. Aftermarket batteries are mostly used for non-critical applications because liability issues could counter any savings gained.\nCaution also applies when purchasing aftermarket chargers. Some low-end units may not terminate the battery correctly and rely on the battery’s internal protection circuit to terminate the charge when the battery is full. Redundancy in charging is important as the protection circuit of a bona fide battery can be damaged(See also BU-304b: Making Lithium-ion Safe)\nAftermarket batteries may also have insufficient safety provisions and rely on the charger to terminate the charge. Marrying the two aftermarket partners could turn battery charging into an unwanted event. Accidents are bound to happen when connecting a mobile phone or e-cigarette to the 12-volt system of a vehicle with a faulty inverter. Personal injury and damage can be the results.\nSome manufacturers of laptops, medical devices, e-bikes and others disallow aftermarket batteries by digitally locking the pack with a tamper-proof security code. This is done in part for safety reasons; it also secures for the manufacturer a future demand for batteries with good margins.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/a-look-at-cell-formats-and-how-to-build-a-good-battery",
        "content": "Early batteries of the 1700s and 1800s were mostly encased in glass jars. As the batteries grew in size, jars shifted to sealed wooden containers and composite materials. There were few size standards, except perhaps the No. 6 Dry Cell named after its six inches of height. Other sizes were hand-built for specific uses. With the move to portability, sealed cylindrical cells emerged that led to standards. In around 1917, the National Institute of Standards and Technology formalized the alphabet nomenclature that is still used today. Table 1 summarizes these historic and current battery sizes.\nSize\nDimensions\nHistory\nF cell\n33 x 91 mm\nIntroduced in 1896 for lanterns; later used for radios; only available in nickel-cadmium today\nE cell\nN/A\nIntroduced ca. 1905 to power box lanterns and hobby applications.

Popular in old laptops and hobby batteries.\nAA cell\n14.5 x 50mm\nIntroduced in 1907 as penlight battery for pocket lights and spy tool in WWI; added to ANSI standard in 1947.\nAAA cell\n10.5 x 44.5mm\nDeveloped in 1954 to reduce size for Kodak and Polaroid cameras. Added to ANSI standard in 1959\nAAAA cell\n8.3 x 42.5mm\nOffshoot of 9V, since 1990s; used for laser pointers, LED penlights, computer styli, headphone amplifiers.\n4.5V battery\n67 x 62x 22mm\nThree cells form a flat pack; short terminal strip is positive, long strip is negative; common in Europe, Russia\n9V battery\n48.5 x 26.5x 17.5mm\nIntroduced in 1956 for transistor radios; contains six prismatic or AAAA cells. Added to ANSI standard in 1959\n18650\n18 x 65mm16.5mL\nDeveloped in the mid-1990s for lithium-ion-ion; commonly used in laptops, e-bikes, including Tesla EV cars\n26650\n26 x 65mm34.5mL\nLarger Li-ion. Some measure 26x70mm sold as 26700. Common chemistry is LiFeO4 for UPS, hobby, automotive.\n14500\n14x 50mm\nLi-ion, similar size to AA. (Observe voltage incompatibility: NiCd/NiMH = 1.2V, alkaline = 1.5V, Li-ion = 3.6V)\nTable 1: Common old and new battery norms\nStandardization included primary cells, mostly in carbon-zinc; alkaline emerged only in the early 1960s. With the popularity of the sealed nickel-cadmium in the 1950s and 1960s, new sizes appeared, many of which were derived from the “A” and “C” sizes. Manufacturers of Li-ion departed from conventional sizes and invented their own.The International Electrochemical Commission (IEC), a non-governmental standards organization founded in 1906, developed standards for most rechargeable batteries under the number of 600086. The relevant US standards are the ANSI C18 series developed by the US National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA).A successful standard for a cylindrical cell is the 18650. Developed in the mid-1990s for lithium-ion, these cells power laptops, electric bicycles and even electric vehicles, as with the Tesla cars. The first two digits designate the diameter in millimeters; the next three digits are the length in tenths of millimeters. The 18650 is 18mm in diameter and 65.0mm in length.Prismatic cells use the first two digits to indicate the thickness in tenth of millimeters. The next two digits designate the widths and the last two provide the length of the cell in millimeters. The 564656P prismatic cell, for example, is 5.6mm thick, 46mm wide and 56mm long. P stands for prismatic. Because of the large variety of chemistries and their diversity within, battery cells do not mark the chemistry.Looking at the batteries in mobile phones and laptops one sees a departure of established standards. This is in part due to the manufacturer’s inability to agree on a standard. Most consumer devices come with a custom-made battery. Compact design and tailoring to market demands are swaying manufacturers away from standards. High volume tolerates unique sizes that are often short-lived. In the early days, a battery was perceived as “big” and this reflects in the sizing convention. While the “F” nomenclature may have been chosen as a middle-of-the-road battery in the late 1800s, our forefathers did not forestall that a tiny battery could do computing, serve as telephone and shoot pictures in a smartphone. Running out of letters towards the smaller sizes led to the awkward of AA, AAA and AAAA designation.Since the introduction of the 9V battery in 1956, no new format emerged. Meanwhile portable devices lowered the operating voltages and 9V is overkill. The battery has six cells in series and is expensive to manufacture. A 3.6V alternative would serve well. This pack should have a coding system to prevent charging primaries and selecting the correct charge algorithm for secondary chemistries.Starter batteries for vehicles also follow battery norms, which consist of the North American BCI, the European DIN and the Japanese JIS standards. These batteries are similar in footprint to allow swapping. To standardize, American car manufacturers are converting to the American DIN size batteries. Deep-cycle and stationary batteries have no standardized norms and the replacement packs must be sourced from the original maker. The attempt to standardize electric vehicle batteries may not work either and follow the failed attempt of common laptop batteries in the 1990s.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-704a-shipping-lithium-based-batteries-by-air",
        "content": "Lithium batteries are dangerous goods and transporting them is only permitted with UN 38.3 certification according to the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) assists by publishing the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) that helps classify, mark, pack, label and document dangerous shipments. DGR is recognized by all major airlines.\nLithium-based batteries are divided into Li-ion found in mobile phones and laptops, as well as the more restrictive lithium-metal used in sensing devices and the consumer grade lithium cells in AA, AAA and 9V formats.\nAirlines allow both types as carry-on, either installed or carried as spare packs, as long as they don’t exceed the following lithium limitation:\nThe lithium content in the battery governs the energy storage capacity (runtime) measured in watt-hours (Wh). The Wh measurement is used to limit the quantity a passenger can bring onboard an aircraft, what can be transported outside of the Class 9 dangerous goods designation, and what mandates Class 9.\nTo calculate the lithium content, multiply the rated capacity (Ah) times 0.3. For example, a 1Ah cell has 0.3 grams of lithium. To derive Wh, multiply Ah by the cell voltage of 3.6V. A typical laptop battery of 14.4V and 5Ah has 72Wh. (Lithium content: 5Ah x 0.3g = 1.5g x 4 cells in series = 6g).\nIATA differentiates between batteries contained in the equipment (non-removable) and batteries that are packaged separately. If contained, such as in watches, smartphones or laptops, the Wh limit is ignored if less than 100Wh. However, if the battery is packaged with the equipment and is interchangeable, such as a removable pack of a power tools, then the battery must be counted. Figures 1a and 1b illustrate examples of “contained in equipment” and “packaged with equipment.”\nSince 2016, lithium batteries can no longer be carried in passenger aircraft as cargo. Under DGR, the packaging instructions (PI) are organized into PI 965 to PI 970. PI 965 covers Li-ion cells and battery packs only (UN3480), while PI 966 includes Li-ion installed in equipment and PI 967 combines Li-ion with equipment (UN3481). Because of higher lithium content, lithium-metal batteries are handled separately under PI 968 to 970 (UN3090 and UN3092). Most lithium-metal are non-rechargeable.\nTransporting lithium batteries is divided into two categories:\nTable 2 divides the transport of Li-ion products into four groups:\nOnly Carry-on and Section II are exempt from Class 9 hazardous material designation. IATA mandates that cells and battery packs cannot be combined in the same shipping box. Use separate boxes.\n1\nPassenger Aircraft Ban: Under Sections II, IA and IB, Li-ion is forbidden on passenger aircraft as cargo. All packages must bear the “Cargo Aircraft Only” label in addition to other required marks and labels. This limitation does not affect lithium-ion batteries packed with or contained in equipment.\nState-of-charge Limits: Li-ion must be shipped at a state-of-charge of no more than 30% of the rated capacity. This does not apply to batteries packed with or contained in equipment.\nOther Restrictions: Shipper can only offer one Section II package (batteries only) per consignment.\nLithium battery shipments must be separated from other cargo.\n2\nTypical smartphone or tablet battery; 3 Typical laptop battery\nAll Li-ion shipment must include the CAUTION labels as shown in Figure 3a to indicate the presence of lithium batteries. Since lithium batteries are only allowed in cargo aircraft, also attach the “Cargo Aircraft Only” label illustrated in Figure 3b. Batteries shipped Class 9 in Section IA and IB must include the Class 9 label as per Figure 3c. The package must also accompany shipping documents with name and address of consignor, date, phone number and description of shipment, including the UN number and weight.\n120mm x 115mm (4.72x4.53”)\n300mm x 300mm (11.8x11.8”)\n100mm x 100mm (3.94x3.94″)\nAll lithium batteries shipped under PI 965 in Sections II, IA and IB must have a state-of-charge (SoC) of 30 percent. This mandate is added because Li-ion is more stable at low SoC than when fully charged. (An analogy is a boiler that is safer at low pressure than when the gauge touches the red line.) An open circuit voltage of 3.70V when rested indicates that the Li-ion cell is roughly at a 30 percent SoC. Discharge Li-ion to 3.65V/cell at moderate current. The 50mV overshoot compensates for the rubber band effect as the battery recovers to 3.70V/cell in time. (See BU-702: How to Store Batteries). Modern battery chargers and analyzers include the AirShip program.\nNote:\nTravel:\nPlacing batteries in checked luggage is not permitted. Passengers must carry the allotted batteries onboard the aircraft. Non-removable batteries are exempt (out of sight, out of mind); however, not all airlines permit checked bags that include embedded Li-ion batteries in devices.\nSafeguard:\nBatteries must be protected against short circuit. Place them in individual plastic bags.\nApproval:\nAll Li-ion batteries shipped under Class 9 hazardous material must meet the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part III, subsection 38.3. A battery pack must be reapproved if the cells are changed. This applies also if the replacement cells have already been approved. The approval is on the entire pack.\nPrototype:\nShipping prototype batteries for testing are exempt. Refer to CFR 49 173.185 (e) regarding shipping of non-UN tested batteries.\nDamage:\nBatteries identified as defective and in danger of failing in transport are forbidden.\nOld batteries:\nLithium-based batteries for disposal are forbidden from air transport unless approved by the appropriate authorities.\nPacking:\nEach shipping package must withstand a 1.2 meter (4 feet) drop in any orientation without damaging the batteries, causing them to shift or releasing the contents.\nOverpack:\nPackages placed in an overpack with other goods cannot contain more than one (1) dangerous goods package in accordance with Section II of PI 965. The overpack can, however, contain other non-dangerous goods or compatible dangerous good items. Add the overpack label (Figure 4) on the shipping box together with the other required labels with respect to multiple packages of regulated batteries.\nTraining:\nPersonnel handling lithium-based batteries for transport must be trained.\nPI 966 governs Li-ion cells and battery packs with equipment under UN 3481, and PI 967 oversees Li-ion cells and battery packs in equipment under UN3481 (Table 5). These rules are similar to PI 965 with the exception that Li-ion cells and battery packs can be shipped with, or in the equipment. Equipment means an apparatus requiring Li-ion products to operate.\nLimitation:\nThe maximum number of batteries in each package must be limited to those required to operate the equipment. Extras must be shipped separately or in an overpack.\nActivation:\nEquipment must be turned OFF. Accidental activation in transport must be prevented. Devices such as watches and temperature loggers that do not pose a danger in transport may be left in the ON position.\nNote:\nThe 30% SoC rule does not apply to batteries packed with or contained in equipment\nLithium-metal batteries have tighter shipping requirements than lithium ion batteries. Most Li-metal is non-rechargeable, and it is used in watches, medical instruments, pacemakers, sensors, memory retention, etc. There are also consumer-grade lithium-metal in AAA, AA, 9V and other formats. Table 6 lists the restrictions in the shipment of these batteries.\nPI 969 includes lithium-metal with the equipment under UN 3091, while PI 970 rules include lithium-metal in the equipment, also under UN 3091 (Table 7).\nShipping prototype batteries, including annual production runs of no more than 100 cells, or batteries for testing, are exempt when adhering to shipping regulations CFR 49 173.185 (e). Shipping non-UN tested batteries is described in: 49 CFR § 173.185 - Lithium cells and batteries.\nIt is FORBIDDEN to ship damaged, defective, recalled or recycled lithium batteries by aircraft. This ban applies for loose cells or batteries, and those contained in equipment.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-601: How does a Smart Battery Work?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-601-how-does-a-smart-battery-work",
        "content": "A speaker at a battery conference once said, “The battery is a wild animal and artificial intelligence domesticates it.” A battery is illusive and does not exhibit visible changes as part of usage; it looks the same when fully charged or empty, new or old and in need of replacement. A car tire, in comparison, distorts when low on air and indicates end-of-life when the treads are worn.\nThe shortcomings of a battery can be summarized by these three concerns: [1] The user does not know how much runtime the pack has left; [2] the host is uncertain if the battery can satisfy the power demand; and [3] the charger must be tailored to each battery size and chemistry. The solutions are complex and the “smart” battery promises to lessen some of these deficiencies.\nBattery users imagine a battery pack as being an energy storage device that resembles a fuel tank dispensing liquid fuel. For simplicity reasons, a battery can be seen as such; however, measuring stored energy from an electrochemical device is far more complex.\nWhile an ordinary fuel gauge measures in-and-out-flowing liquid from a tank of a known size with minimal losses, a battery fuel gauge has unconfirmed definitions and only reveals the open circuit voltage (OCV), which is a fickle reflection of state-of-charge (SoC). To compound the problem, a battery is a leaky and shrinking vessel that loses energy and takes less content with each charge. As the capacity fades, the specified Ah (ampere-hours) rating no longer holds true. Nor can the fuel gauge assess the capacity by itself; the reading always shows full after recharge even if the capacity has dropped to half the specified Ah.\nThe simplest method to measure state-of-charge is reading voltage, but this can be inaccurate as load currents pull the voltage down during discharge. The largest challenge is the flat discharge voltage curve on most lithium and nickel-based batteries. Temperature also plays a role; heat raises the voltage and a cold ambient lowers it. Agitation by a previous charge or discharge causes further errors and the battery needs a few hours rest to neutralize. (See BU-903: How to Measure State-charge)\nMost batteries for medical, military and computing devices are “smart.” This means that some level of communication occurs between the battery, the equipment and the user. The definitions of “smart” vary among manufacturers and regulatory authorities, and the most basic smart battery may contain nothing more than a chip that sets the charger to the correct charge algorithm. In the eyes of the Smart Battery System (SBS) forum, these batteries cannot be called smart. The SBS forum states that a smart battery must provide state-of-charge indications.\nSafety is a key design objective and the concept behind SBS is to place system intelligence inside the battery pack. The SBS battery thus communicates with the charge management chip in a closed loop. In spite of this digital supervision, most SBS chargers also rely on analog signals from the chemical battery to terminate the charge when the battery is full. Furthermore, redundant temperature sensing is added for safety reasons.\nBenchmarq was the first company to offer fuel-gauge technology in 1990. Today, many manufacturers offer integrated circuit (IC) chips in single-wire and two-wire systems, also known as System Management Bus (SMBus).\nState-of-charge estimations in a smart battery commonly include coulomb counting, a theory that goes back 250 years when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb first established the “Coulomb Rule.” Figure 1 illustrates the principle of coulomb counting, measuring in-and-out flowing energy. One coulomb (1C) per second is one ampere (1A). Discharging a battery at 1A for one hour equates to 3,600C. (Not to be confused with C-rate.)\nCoulomb counting should be flawless but errors occur. If, for example, a battery was charged for 1 hour at 1 ampere, the same amount of energy should be available on discharge, and no battery can deliver this. Inefficiencies in charge acceptance, especially towards the end of charge and particularly if fast-charged, reduces the energy efficiency. Losses also occur in storage and during discharge. The available energy is always less than what has been fed into the battery.\nThe single-wire system, also known as 1-Wire, communicates through one wire at low speed. Designed by Dallas Semiconductor Corp., the 1-Wire combines data and clock into one line for transmission; the Manchester code, also known as phase coding, separates the data at the receiving end. For safety reasons, most batteries also run a separate wire for temperature sensing. Figure 2 shows the layout of a single-wire system.\nThe single-wire system stores the battery code and tracks battery data that typically includes voltage, current, temperature and state-of-charge information. Because of the relatively low hardware cost, the single-wire system is attractive for price-sensitive devices such as measuring instruments, mobile phones, two-way radios, cameras and scanners.\nMost single-wire systems have their own protocol and use a customized charger. The Benchmarq single-wire solution, for example, cannot measure the current directly; state-of-health (SoH) measurement is only possible when “marrying” the host to a designated battery.\nThe System Management Bus (SMBus) represents a concerted effort to agree on one communications protocol and one set of data. Derived from I2C, the Duracell/Intel smart battery system was standardized in 1995 and consists of two separate lines for data and clock. I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a multi-master, multi-slave, single-ended, serial computer bus invented by Philips Semiconductor. Figure 3 shows the layout of the two-wire SMBus system.\nThe philosophy behind the SMBus battery was to remove charge control from the charger and assign it to the battery. With a true SMBus system, the battery becomes the master and the charger the slave that obeys the command of the battery. This enables a universal charger to service present and future battery chemistries by applying correct charge algorithms.\nDuring the 1990s, several standardized SMBus battery packs emerged, including the 35 and 202 (Figure 4). Manufactured by Sony, Hitachi, GP Batteries and others, these interchangeable batteries were designed to power a broad range of portable devices, such as laptops and medical instruments. The idea was solid but standardization diverged as most manufacturers began building their own packs.\nTo prevent unauthorized batteries from infiltrating the market, some manufacturers add a code to exclude other pack vendors. A few manufacturers go as far as to invalidate the battery when a given cycle count is reached. To avoid surprises, most of these systems inform the user of the pending end-of-life.\nAn SMBus battery contains permanent and temporary data. The battery manufacturer program the permanent data into the battery, which includes battery ID, battery type, manufacturer’s name, serial number and date of manufacture. The temporary data is added during use and contains cycle count, usage pattern and maintenance requirements. Some of the information is kept, while other data is renewed throughout the life of the battery. The voltage is typically measured in 1mV increments; the current resolution is 0.5mA; temperature accuracy is about ±3ºC.\nSmart battery chargers are divided into Level 1, 2 and 3. Level 1 has been discontinued because it does not provide chemistry-independent charging and it supported a single chemistry only. A Level 2 charger is fully controlled by the Smart Battery and acts as an SMBus slave, responding to voltage and current commands from the Smart Battery. Level 2 also serves as in-circuit charging, a practice that is common in laptops. Another use is a battery with a built-in charging circuit. In Level 2, battery and circuit are married to each other.\nA level 3 charger can interpret commands from a Smart Battery, as is done with Level 2, and also act as master. In other words, the Level 3 charger can request charging information from the Smart Battery but it can also impose its own charging algorithm by responding to the “chemical” battery. Most industrial smart chargers are based on the hybrid type Level 3.\nSome lower-cost chargers have emerged that accommodate SMBus batteries, but these may not be fully SBS compliant. Manufacturers of SMBus batteries do not endorse this shortcut because of safety concerns. Applications such as biomedical instruments, data collection devices and survey equipment lean towards Level 3 chargers with full-fledged charge protocols.

The systems usually last 3 to 4 years if you have good photovoltaic cells and positioning is optimal. I have found any type of resistance load or inductive load is not good and cuts life by at least 80% in a high demand situation thus for leaving the user with the reality of a bad choice. And the extreme cold was much worse when the seasons changed. Hence welcome to Wyoming. Yea fact I whitenesses it and did not enjoy changing out 110 amp batteries every day. The sun savers and solar panels were not the problem. Batteries are ok for data acquisition that was all, and small power outputs on and off. Lead could at least be recycled lithium ion needs help in that region. And I found when I went ice fishing lithium ion lasted about 20+ or - % longer. Yes EL FACTO. So it’s not near as peachy as green advocates push.

        "content": "Lifting off in a large airplane is exhilarating. At a full weight of almost 400 tons, the Boeing 747 requires 90 megawatts of power to get airborne. Take-off is the most demanding part of a flight and when reaching cruising altitude the power consumption decreases to roughly half.\nPowerful engines were also used to propel the mighty Queen Mary that was launched in 1934. The 81,000-ton ocean liner measuring 300 meters (1,000ft) in length was powered by four steam turbines producing a total power of 160,000hp (120 megawatts). The ship carried 3,000 people and traveled at a speed of 28.5 knots (52km/h). Queen Mary is now a museum in Long Beach, California.\nTable 1 illustrates man’s inventiveness in the quest for power by comparing an ox of prehistoric times with newer energy sources made available during the Industrial Revolution to today’s super engines, with seemingly unlimited power.\nLarge propulsion systems are only feasible with the internal combustion engines (ICE), and fossil fuel serves as a cheap and plentiful energy resource. Low energy-to-weight ratio in terms of net calorific value (NCV) puts the battery against the mighty ICE like David and Goliath. The battery is the weaker vessel and is sensitive to extreme heat and cold; it also has a relatively short life span.\nWhile fossil fuel delivers an NCV of 12,000Wh/kg, Li-ion provides only between 70Wh/kg and 260Wh/kg depending on chemistry; less with most other systems. Even at a low efficiency of about 30 percent, the ICE outperforms the best battery in terms of energy-to-weight ratio. The battery capacity would need to increase 20-fold before it could compete head-to-head with fossil fuel.\nAnother limitation of battery propulsion over fossil fuel is fuel by weight. While the weight diminishes when being consumed, the battery carries the same deadweight whether fully charged or empty. This puts limitations on EV driving distance and would make the electric airplane impractical. Furthermore, the ICE delivers full power at freezing temperatures, runs in hot climates, and continues to perform well with advancing age. This is not the case with a battery as each subsequent discharge delivers slightly less energy than the previous cycle.\nEnergy from a non-rechargeable battery is one of the most expensive forms of electrical supply in terms of cost per kilowatt-hours (kWh). Primary batteries are used for low-power applications such as wristwatches, remote controls, electric keys and children’s toys. Military in combat, light beacons and remote repeater stations also use primaries because charging is not practical. Table 2 estimates the capability and cost per kWh of primary batteries.\nElectric energy from rechargeable batteries is more economical than with primaries, however, the cost per kWh is not complete without examining the total cost of ownership. This includes cost per cycle, longevity, eventual replacement and disposal. Table 3 compares Lead acid, NiCd, NiMH and Li-ion.\n~$100 (2021)\nTo reduce the fossil fuel consumption and to lower emissions, governments and the private sector are studying alternate energy sources. Table 4 compares the cost to generate 1kW of power that includes initial investment, fuel consumption, maintenance and eventual replacement.\n* Amortization of investment yielding 200 days of 5h/day sun; declining output with age not included.\nPower from the electrical utility grid is most cost-effective. Consumers pay between $0.06 and $0.40US per kWh, delivered with no added maintenance cost or the need to replace aging power-generating machinery; the supply is continuous. (The typical daily energy consumption per household in the West is 25kW.)\nThe supply of cheap electricity changes when energy must be stored in a battery, as is the case with a solar system that is backed up by a battery and in the electric powertrain. High battery cost and a relatively short life can double the electrical cost if supplied by a battery. Gasoline (and equivalent) is the most economical solution for mobility.\nThe fuel cell is most effective in converting fuel to electricity, but high equipment costs make this power source expensive in terms of cost per kWh. In virtually all applications, power from the fuel cell is considerably more expensive than from conventional methods.\nOur bodies also consume energy, and an active man requires 3,500 calories per day to stay fit. This relates to roughly 4,000 watts in a 24-hour day (1 food Calorie* = 1.16 watt-hour). Walking propels a person about 40km (25 miles) per day, and a bicycle increases the distance by a factor of four to 160km (100 miles). Eating two potatoes and a sausage for lunch propels a bicyclist for the afternoon, covering 60km (37 miles, a past-time activity I often do. Not all energy goes to the muscles alone; the brain consumes about 20 percent of our intake. The human body is amazingly efficient in converting food to energy; one would think that the potato and sausage lunch could hardly keep a laptop going for that long. Table 5 provides the stored energies of calories, proteins and fat in watt-hours and joules.\n* A calorie specifies the energy level food provides to the body. Kilocalories on food packages and related nutrition are normally published in “Calories with capital “C”. Example: 800 Calories on the food label are in essence 800 kilocalories. Table 5 below uses the official standard of 1.16mWh/cal.\nTable 6 compares the estimated power and energy per passenger/kilometer for a loaded Boeing 747, the retired Queen Mary ocean liner, a gas-guzzling SUV, a fit person on a bicycle, and walking on foot.\n* 1 joule is the energy of 1A at 1V for 1 second, or 1 watt times second.4.186 joules raise the temperature of 1g of water by 1 Celsius; 1,000 joules are 0.277Wh.\nThe bicycle is by far the most effective form of transportation. Comparing a bicycle to a car, a cyclist would only consume 0.4 liter of fuel per 100km (630mpg). Walking is also efficient; it uses about 1 liter per 100km (228mpg). The problem with self-powered propulsion is the limited travel range before fatigue sets in.\nIn terms of energy usage, cars are one of the least efficient modes of transportation. Most ICEs utilize only 25 percent of the net calorific value from the fuel for propulsion. The math looks even worse when including vehicle weight and a single passenger, the driver. The ratio of machine to man is about ten-to-one, higher on a large vehicle. When accelerating a 1.5-ton vehicle, less than 2 percent of the energy moves the 75kg (165 lb) driver, his briefcase and his lunch bag; 98 percent goes to heat and friction. Even a modern jet plane has better fuel efficiency than a car. A loaded Airbus 340 gets 3.4l/100km (70mpg), cruising at 950km/h (594mph).\nTrains are one of the most efficient modes of transportation. The 36km Yamanote circle line, connecting major urban centers in Tokyo carries 3.5 million passengers per day. During rush hour, the 11-car train runs every 150 seconds. Such a passenger volume would be unthinkable by private cars on city streets.\nModern trains are less intrusive than freeways to move people and goods. Building efficient public transportation systems would give cities back to the people who are the rightful owners. The most desirable cities were built before the arrival of the car as designers had the well-being of people in mind. Trains are also economical to move freight. Transporting one ton of freight consumes only 0.65 liters of fuel per 100km (362mpg).\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Is Lithium-ion the Ideal Battery?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/is-lithium-ion-the-ideal-battery",
        "content": "For many years, nickel-cadmium had been the only suitable battery for portable equipment from wireless communications to mobile computing. Nickel-metal-hydride and lithium-ion emerged In the early 1990s, fighting nose-to-nose to gain customer's acceptance. Today, lithium-ion is the fastest growing and most promising battery chemistry.\nPioneer work with the lithium battery began in 1912 under G.N. Lewis but it was not until the early 1970s when the first non-rechargeable lithium batteries became commercially available. lithium is the lightest of all metals, has the greatest electrochemical potential and provides the largest energy density for weight.\nAttempts to develop rechargeable lithium batteries failed due to safety problems. Because of the inherent instability of lithium metal, especially during charging, research shifted to a non-metallic lithium battery using lithium ions. Although slightly lower in energy density than lithium metal, lithium-ion is safe, provided certain precautions are met when charging and discharging. In 1991, the Sony Corporation commercialized the first lithium-ion battery. Other manufacturers followed suit.\nThe energy density of lithium-ion is typically twice that of the standard nickel-cadmium. There is potential for higher energy densities. The load characteristics are reasonably good and behave similarly to nickel-cadmium in terms of discharge. The high cell voltage of 3.6 volts allows battery pack designs with only one cell. Most of today's mobile phones run on a single cell. A nickel-based pack would require three 1.2-volt cells connected in series.\nLithium-ion is a low maintenance battery, an advantage that most other chemistries cannot claim. There is no memory and no scheduled cycling is required to prolong the battery's life. In addition, the self-discharge is less than half compared to nickel-cadmium, making lithium-ion well suited for modern fuel gauge applications. lithium-ion cells cause little harm when disposed.\nDespite its overall advantages, lithium-ion has its drawbacks. It is fragile and requires a protection circuit to maintain safe operation. Built into each pack, the protection circuit limits the peak voltage of each cell during charge and prevents the cell voltage from dropping too low on discharge. In addition, the cell temperature is monitored to prevent temperature extremes. The maximum charge and discharge current on most packs are is limited to between 1C and 2C. With these precautions in place, the possibility of metallic lithium plating occurring due to overcharge is virtually eliminated.\nAging is a concern with most lithium-ion batteries and many manufacturers remain silent about this issue. Some capacity deterioration is noticeable after one year, whether the battery is in use or not. The battery frequently fails after two or three years. It should be noted that other chemistries also have age-related degenerative effects. This is especially true for nickel-metal-hydride if exposed to high ambient temperatures. At the same time, lithium-ion packs are known to have served for five years in some applications.\nManufacturers are constantly improving lithium-ion. New and enhanced chemical combinations are introduced every six months or so. With such rapid progress, it is difficult to assess how well the revised battery will age.\nStorage in a cool place slows the aging process of lithium-ion (and other chemistries). Manufacturers recommend storage temperatures of 15°C (59°F). In addition, the battery should be partially charged during storage. The manufacturer recommends a 40% charge.\nThe most economical lithium-ion battery in terms of cost-to-energy ratio is the cylindrical 18650 (size is 18mm x 65.2mm). This cell is used for mobile computing and other applications that do not demand ultra-thin geometry. If a slim pack is required, the prismatic lithium-ion cell is the best choice. These cells come at a higher cost in terms of stored energy.\nThe lithium-polymer differentiates itself from conventional battery systems in the type of electrolyte used. The original design, dating back to the 1970s, uses a dry solid polymer electrolyte. This electrolyte resembles a plastic-like film that does not conduct electricity but allows ions exchange (electrically charged atoms or groups of atoms). The polymer electrolyte replaces the traditional porous separator, which is soaked with electrolyte.\nThe dry polymer design offers simplifications with respect to fabrication, ruggedness, safety and thin-profile geometry. With a cell thickness measuring as little as one millimeter (0.039 inches), equipment designers are left to their own imagination in terms of form, shape and size.\nUnfortunately, the dry lithium-polymer suffers from poor conductivity. The internal resistance is too high and cannot deliver the current bursts needed to power modern communication devices and spin up the hard drives of mobile computing equipment. Heating the cell to 60°C (140°F) and higher increases the conductivity, a requirement that is unsuitable for portable applications.\nTo compromise, some gelled electrolyte has been added. The commercial cells use a separator/ electrolyte membrane prepared from the same traditional porous polyethylene or polypropylene separator filled with a polymer, which gels upon filling with the liquid electrolyte. Thus the commercial lithium-ion polymer cells are very similar in chemistry and materials to their liquid electrolyte counter parts.\nLithium-ion-polymer has not caught on as quickly as some analysts had expected. Its superiority to other systems and low manufacturing costs has not been realized. No improvements in capacity gains are achieved - in fact, the capacity is slightly less than that of the standard lithium-ion battery. Lithium-ion-polymer finds its market niche in wafer-thin geometries, such as batteries for credit cards and other such applications.\nAir travelers ask the question, \"How much lithium in a battery am I allowed to bring on board?\" We differentiate between two battery types: Lithium metal and lithium-ion. Most lithium metal batteries are non-rechargeable and are used in film cameras. Lithium-ion packs are rechargeable and power laptops, cellular phones and camcorders. Both battery types, including spare packs, are allowed as carry-on but cannot exceed the following lithium content:\nLithium-ion batteries exceeding 8 grams but no more than 25 grams may be carried in carry-on baggage if individually protected to prevent short circuits and are limited to two spare batteries per person.\nHow do I know the lithium content of a lithium-ion battery? From a theoretical perspective, there is no metallic lithium in a typical lithium-ion battery. There is, however, equivalent lithium content that must be considered. For a lithium-ion cell, this is calculated at 0.3 times the rated capacity (in ampere-hours).\nExample: A 2Ah 18650 Li-ion cell has 0.6 grams of lithium content. On a typical 60 Wh laptop battery with 8 cells (4 in series and 2 in parallel), this adds up to 4.8g. To stay under the 8-gram UN limit, the largest battery you can bring is 96 Wh. This pack could include 2.2Ah cells in a 12 cells arrangement (4s3p). If the 2.4Ah cell were used instead, the pack would need to be limited to 9 cells (3s3p).\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

Suggest you try another voltmeter, ideally a calibrated digital meter.\napplication requirements that [url=https://carplate.sg/] Vintage Number Plate [/url]\nMy father has purchased a Lithium Ion battery for use with a powered wheel.  The battery is rated for 48 volt and the charger used was the same charger supplied with the battery by the manufacturer.  There have been problems with the project; however, one very inconvenient problem is that battery measures 1000v DC.  I have found this most perplexing and have completed several checks myself and concluded that the measured voltage output is 1000v DC.\nThe ambient temperature for operation has been between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.  There is no indication of thermal runaway (a condition mentioned in papers on lithium ion batteries).  I have checked the output of the battery and the input line of the charging circuit.  I have used two different analog meters for my measurements.

        "content": "Consumers are the first to hear about an apparent battery breakthrough. To get top media attention, the new super battery promises to also satisfy the need for electric vehicle (EV). Personal mobility is an emotional issue that cannot be suppressed, even if it harms the environment. The industrial space, on the other hand, is more conservative and it appears to lag behind. Not so. Industry is rational and understands the many constraints of the battery by focusing on reliability, economy, longevity and safety.\nWheelchairs, scooters and golf cars mostly use lead acid batteries. Even though heavy, lead acid works reasonably well and only moderate attempts are made to switch to other systems Li-ion will be a natural alternative in many applications.\nAlthough Li-ion is more expensive than lead acid, the cycle cost can be lower because of the longer life. A further advantage of Li-ion over lead- and nickel-based batteries is the low maintenance. Li-ion can be left at any state-of-charge without adverse side effects. In contrast, NiCd and NiMH need an occasional full discharge to prevent memory and lead acid requires a saturated charge to prevent sulfation.\nMost wheelchairs and golf cars are still powered with lead acid, so are forklifts. With forklifts, the heavy weight is less of an issue, but the long charging time is a disadvantage for warehouses operating 24 hours a day. Some forklifts are fitted with fuel cells that charge the battery while the vehicle is in use. The battery can be made smaller but not eliminated because the fuel cell has poor power delivery and has a sluggish ramp-up on demand; the battery remains the primary power source.\nThe heavier the wheeled application is, the less suitable the battery becomes. This does not prevent engineers from looking into large battery systems to replace the polluting internal combustion engine (ICE). One such application is the Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) system at ship ports. AGVs run 24 hours a day and the vehicles cannot be tied up for lengthy charging intervals. Li-ion solves this in part by replacing the very large 10-ton, 300kWh lead acid with a battery that is lighter and can be charged more quickly. But very large batteries have a limitation because of weight, charging time and infrastructure and the fuel cell may solve large traction systems as described in BU-1005 if burning fossil fuel is not an option.\nHowever, no economical battery solution exists yet for large traction systems and burning fossil fuel cannot be fully avoided. While a modern Li-ion battery delivers about 150Wh/kg of energy, the net calorific value (NCV) of fossil fuel is over 12,000Wh/kg. Even at the low 25-percent efficiency of an ICE engine, the energy from a battery is fractional compared to fossil fuel(See BU-1007: Net Calorific Value) Furthermore, the ICE can operate in extreme cold and heat, a task the battery struggles to meet.\nThe duty of batteries on board an aircraft is to feed navigation and emergency systems when the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) is off or during an emergency in flight. The battery provides power for braking, ground operation and starting the APU. In the event of engine failure, the batteries must supply energy from 30 minutes to 3 hours. Each aircraft must also have enough battery power to facilitate a safe landing. During flight, the electrical power is supplied by generators and, similar to a car, the on-board battery could be disconnected if so required.\nMost commercial jetliners use flooded nickel-cadmium. Starting a large aircraft begins by spooling the APU, a small turbine engine located at the tail section of an airplane. This takes significantly longer and requires more energy than cranking a reciprocating engine of similar size. The spooling speed of the APU must be sufficiently high to attain compression for self-sustained ignition. Starting takes about 15 seconds and consumes 15kW of energy. Once running, an air compressor or hydraulic pump jumpstarts the large jet engines one-by-one.\nSmaller aircraft often have sealed lead-acid. Although heavier than NiCd, lead acid requires less maintenance. The 12 and 24V aviation batteries are rated in IPP (current peak power)* and IPR (current power rating)** rather than CCA (cold cranking amps) as is common in the automotive industry. IPP and IPR are the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 60952-1) standard for aircraft batteries and FAA TSO-C173 that allow a battery to spool each engine for 25–40 seconds at high current.\nModern jet fighters spool the jet engines with Li-ion, so does the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The Airbus 350 offers the option of either chemistry. As the on-board functions of an airliner move from hydraulic to electrical, larger batteries are required. The higher energy-dense Li-ion satisfies this demand better than NiCd and lead acid. However, unexpected Li-ion failure with serious consequences may move airplane makers back to NiCd. All batteries are subject to breakdowns; there are also reported heat failures with NiCd, but these can be better managed than Li-ion.\nNiCd provides durability and reliable service, but it needs high maintenance that includes exercising the battery to eliminate memory. The service of the main-ship battery consists of a total discharge and shorting each cell for 24 hours with a strap. The battery is also checked for capacity with a battery analyzer. Smaller NiCd batteries have different service requirements.\nAlthough aircraft carry many different batteries aboard, their sole purpose is to start the engine and provide backup power when the engines are off. Large aircraft will continue to fly on fossil fuel as batteries are not yet practical for propulsion. Small battery-powered airplanes are being tried for pilot training and to fly short hops but these are experimental only. Weight and reliability on an aging battery remain major concerns.\nEarly satellites used NiCd batteries, and this led to the discovery of the “memory” phenomenon. The battery followed a routine discharge schedule but when more energy was demanded, the battery could remember. The voltage would drop as if to protest against unwanted overtime.\nNiCd was replaced by nickel-hydrogen as a battery with an exceptional long service life. Entrepreneurs tried to introduce this amazing battery for commercial use but high price and large size spoiled market acceptance. Each cell costs around $1,000 and has the appearance of a small steam engine with a steel pressure tank.\nLi-ion is the battery of choice for satellites. It is light-weight, easy to charge, durable and cycles well. Li-ion can dwell in any SoC for an extended length of time without adverse side effects; it has low self-discharge and is virtually maintenance free.\nThe Mars Curiosity Rover uses specially designed lithium nickel oxide cells (LiNiCo) in 8S2P formation (eight cells in series and two in parallel) that is only partially charged and discharged to stretch longevity. Under this regime, the life span is four years and roughly 700 sol. (The term sol is used by planetary astronomers to refer to the duration of a solar day on Mars.) The 43Ah cells, of which two are in parallel, have a maximum discharge C-rate of 0.55C.\nNASA wants Li-ion batteries to last for 7 years and 37,000 cycles with a DoD of 40 to 60 percent. NASA labs reveal that end-of-life is connected with the growth of the SEI layer on the anode, loss of cathode material, loss of conductive path, plating of metallic lithium and electrolyte oxidation. Large 140Ah Li-ion cells are in development that promise to last up to 18 years(See also BU-808B: What causes Li-ion to die?)\nWith a growing choice of batteries for energy storage systems (ESS), the selection should not be based on price alone. Cost per kWh says little without also examining the total cost of ownership that includes cost per cycle, longevity and eventual replacement.\nLead acid is well suited for duties that need only occasional discharges. The flow battery and sodium-sulfur battery work well for large systems requiring regimented discharges, while lithium ion is recommended for small to medium systems delivering short discharging with fast charging ability multiple times a day.\nTraditionally, stationary batteries have been lead acid. Size and weight is of lesser concern, and the limited cycle count does not pose a problem when the batteries are seldom discharged. Large stationary batteries are mostly flooded and require regular checking of the electrolyte level. This maintenance can be reduced with an automatic watering system.\nValve-regulated lead acid (VRLA) is the low-maintenance version of the flooded lead acid. It is said that VRLA can be installed and forgotten, but this is often taken to the extreme in that the batteries get neglected. Maintenance includes checking the voltage, internal resistance and sometimes capacity levels.\nApplications that are exposed to hot and cold temperatures as well as those requiring deep cycling are often served by flooded nickel-cadmium. These batteries are more rugged than lead acid but are roughly four times the cost. Flooded nickel-cadmium batteries are non-sintered and are less subject to memory that the sintered versions, which are sealed, but some maintenance is still required. NiCd is the only battery that can be rapidly charged with minimal stress.\nMany stationary batteries are also served by Li-ion. Li-ion comes with many advantages, but the battery does not perform as well as NiCd and lead acid at low temperature. Another battery that is making a comeback for stationary use is nickel-iron. Inventor Thomas Edison promoted NiFe for the electric vehicle, but it eventually lost out to lead acid due to high cost and high self-discharge. Improvements have eliminated some of the failings, and the superior durability of this battery is gaining renewed interest.\nRenewable energy sources such as wind and sun do not provide a steady stream of energy, nor do they always harmonize with user demand. Large energy storage systems (ESS) called load leveling or grid storage batteries are needed to provide a seamless service.\nESS enjoys a large growth trajectory to move from coal and oil to renewable resources. ESS installations in South Africa alone are estimated to reach 1,500MWh by 2021. Chemistries under consideration are flow batteries, Li-ion, lead acid and zinc-bromine. Zinc-bromine is a type of hybrid flow battery that can be regarded as an electroplating machine. During charge, zinc electroplates onto conductive electrodes forming bromine; the process reverses on discharge. Another leading ESS battery is the high temperature sodium-sulfur battery.\nStoring energy to supply peak shaving power is not new. Hydroelectric power stations use excess electricity to pump water back up to the reservoir at night for use the next day. With an efficiency factor of 70–85 percent, pumped hydro is easier to manage than adjusting the generators to the exact power need. Pumping compressed air into large underground cavities and underwater balloons are also being used to store energy.\nFlywheels also serve as energy storage. Large electric motors rev up one-ton flywheels when excess energy is available to supply brief energy deficiencies. High-speed flywheels spin at over 30,000 rpm on magnetic bearings in a vacuum chamber. Electric motors/generators with permanent magnets charge and discharge the kinetic energy on demand.\nModern flywheels replace steel with carbon fibers to withstand higher rotations of up to 60,000 rpm. Energy increases by the square of speed, providing four times the power at a reduced weight. Should the flywheel fail, the housing prevents shrapnel form escaping.\nUsing flywheels to store kinetic energy is not new. In the 1940s and 1950s, city busses in Switzerland were powered by flywheels. An electric motor would spin a 3-ton flywheel to 3,000 rpm in 3 minutes. Turning into a generator, the motor would then transform the energy back into electricity. Each charge would yield for 6km (3.75mi) on a flat road. The bus was pollution-free but the gyroscope action resisted changing direction on a windy road.\nLoad leveling is gravitating towards Li-ion because of small footprint, low maintenance and long life. Li-ion does not suffer from sulfation as lead acid does when not fully charged periodically. This can be a major drawback with installations when demand exceeds supply. Li-ion also has the benefit of being light-weight and semi-portable for installations in remote locations. The negatives of Li-ion are its high price and low performance at cold temperature. A further drawback is the inability to charge below freezing.\nLi-ion has come down in price and Table 1 provides a cost comparison with lead acid for grid storage applications. Although the initial price of Li-ion is higher than lead acid, the cost per cycle is lower in deep-cycle applications. Li-ion is said to gain in market share but lead acid will keep its stronghold.\nThe energy output of a large industrial wind turbine is 1 megawatt (MW) and more; the biggest units have grown to 10MW. Several turbines form a wind farm that produces 30–300MW. To fathom a megawatt, 1MW feeds 50 houses or a Walmart superstore.\nNot all renewable energy systems include load leveling batteries. The batteries simply get too large and the investment cannot always be justified. If supported by batteries, a 30MW wind farm uses a storage battery of about 15MW. This is the equivalent of 20,000 starter batteries or 176 Tesla S 85 EVs with an 85kWh battery each. The cost to store energy in a battery is high, and some say it doubles the cost to a direct supply.\nThe battery management system (BMS) keeps the battery at about 50 percent charge to allow absorbing energy on wind gusts and delivering on high load demands. Modern BMS can switch from charge to discharge in less than a second. This helps stabilize the voltage on transmission lines, also known as frequency regulation.\n[1] Courtesy: http://www.powertechsystems.eu...\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "During the nickel-cadmium years in the 1970s and 1980s, most battery ills were blamed on “memory.” Memory is derived from “cyclic memory,” meaning that a nickel-cadmium battery could remember how much energy was drawn on previous discharges and would not deliver more than was demanded before. On a discharge beyond regular duty, the voltage would abruptly drop as if to rebel against pending overtime. Improvements in battery technology have virtually eliminated the phenomenon of cycling memory.\nFigure 1 illustrates the stages of crystalline formation that occur on a nickel-cadmium cell if overcharged and not maintained with periodic deep discharges. The first enlargement shows the cadmium plate in a normal crystal structure; the middle image demonstrates full-blown crystalline formation; and the third reveals some form of restoration.\nNew nickel-cadmium cell.The anode (negative electrode) is in fresh condition. Hexagonal cadmium-hydroxide crystals are about 1 micron in cross section, exposing large surface area to the electrolyte for maximum performance.\nCell with crystalline formation.Crystals havegrown to 50 to 100 microns in cross section, concealing large portions of the active material from the electrolyte. Jagged edges and sharp corners can pierce the separator, leading to increased self-discharge or electrical short.\nRestored cell.After a pulsed charge, the crystals are reduced to 3–5 microns, an almost 100% restoration. Exercise or recondition is needed if the pulse charge alone is not effective.\nFigure 1: Crystalline formation on nickel-cadmium cell. Crystalline formation occurs over a few months if battery is overcharged and not maintained with periodic deep discharges.\nCourtesy of the US Army Electronics Command in Fort Monmouth, NJ\nThe modern nickel-cadmium battery is no longer affected by cyclic memory but suffers from crystalline formation.The active cadmium material is applied on the negative electrode plate, and with incorrect use a crystalline formation occurs that reduces the surface area of the active material. This lowers battery performance. In advanced stages, the sharp edges of the forming crystals can penetrate the separator, causing high self-discharge that can lead to an electrical short. The term “memory” on the modern NiCd refers to crystalline formation rather than the cycling memory of old.\nWhen nickel-metal-hydride was introduced in the early 1990s, this chemistry was promoted as being memory-free but this claim is only partially true. NiMH is also subject to memory but to a lesser degree than NiCd. While NiMH has only the nickel plate to worry about, NiCd also includes the memory-prone cadmium negative electrode. This is a non-scientific explanation of why nickel-cadmium is more susceptible to memory than nickel-metal-hydride.\nCrystalline formation occurs if a nickel-based battery is left in the charger for days or repeatedly recharged without a periodic full discharge. Since most applications fall into this user pattern, NiCd requires a periodic discharge to one volt per cell to prolong service life. A discharge/charge cycle as part of maintenance, known as exercise, should be done every one to three months.Avoid over-exercising as this wears down the battery unnecessarily.\nIf regular exercise is omitted for six months and longer, the crystals ingrain themselves and a full restoration with a discharge to one volt per cell may no longer be sufficient. However, a restoration is often still possible by applying a secondary discharge called “recondition.” Recondition is a slow discharge that drains the battery to a voltage cut-off point of about 0.4V/cell and lower. Tests done by the US Army indicate that a NiCd cell needs to be discharged to at least 0.6V to effectively break up the more resistant crystalline formations. During this corrective discharge, the current must be kept low to minimize cell reversal and, as discussed earlier, NiCd can tolerate a small amount of cell reversal. Figure 2 illustrates the battery voltage during a discharge to 1V/cell, followed by the secondary discharge to 0.4V/cell.\nFigure 2: Exercise and recondition features of a Cadex battery analyzer\nRecondition restores NiCd batteries with hard-to-remove memory. Recondition is a slow, deep dis-charge to 0.4V/cell.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nRecondition is most effective with healthy batteries and the remedy is also known to improve new packs. Similar to a medical treatment, however, the service should only be applied when so needed because over-use will stress the battery. Automated battery analyzers (Cadex) only apply the recondition cycle if the user-set target capacity cannot be reached.\nRecondition is only effective on working batteries. Best results in recovery are possible when applying a full discharge every 1–3 months. If exercise has been withheld for 6–12 months, the capacity may not recover fully, and if it does the pack might suffer from high self-discharge caused by a marred separator. Older batteries do not restore well and many get worse with recondition. When this happens, the battery is a ripe candidate for retirement.\nAfter the Balkan War in the 1990s, the Dutch Army began servicing its arsenal of nickel-cadmium batteries that had been used for the two-way radios. The technicians in charge wanted to know the remaining capacity and how many batteries could be restored to full service using battery analyzers (Cadex). The army knew that allowing the batteries to sit in the chargers with only two to three hours of use per day during the war was not ideal, and the tests showed that the capacity on some packs had dropped to a low 30 percent. With the recondition function, however, nine out of 10 batteries could be restored to 80 percent and higher. The army uses 80 percent as a threshold for usability. At time of service, the nickel-cadmiumbatteries were two to three years old.\nTo analyze the effectiveness of battery maintenance further, the US Navy carried out a study to find out how user pattern affects the life of nickel-cadmium batteries. For this, the research team responsible for the program established three battery groups. One group received charge only (no maintenance); another was periodically exercised (discharge to 1V/cell); and a third group received recondition. The 2,600 batteries studied were used for Motorola two-way radios deployed on three US aircraft carriers. Table 3 summarizes the test results, including the cost factor.\nMaintenance method\nAnnual % of batteries requiring replacement\nAnnual battery cost(US$)\nCharge-and-use only\nExercise\nRecondition\n45%\n14%\n5%\n$40,500\n$13,500\n$4,500\nTable 3: Replacement rates of nickel-cadmium batteriesExercise and recondition prolong battery life by three- and ninefold respectively.\nGTE Government Systems, the organization that conducted the test, learned that with charge-and-use the annual percentage of battery failure was 45 percent; with exercise the failure rate was reduced to 15 percent; and with recondition only 5 percent failed. The GTE report concludes that a battery analyzer featuring exercise and recondition costing US$2,500 would return the investment in less than one month on battery savings alone.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-803a: Cell Matching and Balancing",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-803a-cell-matching-and-balancing",
        "content": "A manufacturer cannot predict the exact capacity when the cell comes off the production line, and this is especially true with lead acid and other batteries that involve manual assembly. Even fully automated cell production in clean rooms causes performance differences. As part of quality control, each cell is measured and segregated into categories according to their capacity levels. The high-capacity NiMH and other cells may be reserved for special applications and sold at premium prices; the large mid-range will go to commercial and industrial markets; and the low-grade cells might end up in a consumer product or in a department store. Cycling will not significantly improve the capacity of the low-end cell, and the buyer should be aware of differences in capacity and quality, which often translate into life expectancy.\nCell matching according to capacity is important, especially for industrial batteries, and no perfect match is possible. If slightly off, nickel-based cells adapt to each other after a few charge/discharge cycles similar to the players on a winning sports team. High-quality cells continue to perform longer than the lower-quality counterparts, and fading is more even and controlled. Lower-grade cells, on the other hand, diverge more quickly with use and time, and failures due to cell mismatch are more widespread. Cell mismatch is a common cause of failure in industrial batteries. Manufacturers of professional power tools and medical equipment are careful with the choice of cells to attain good battery reliability and long life.\nLet’s look at what happens to a weak cell that is strung together with stronger cells in a pack. The weak cell holds less capacity and is discharged more quickly than their strong brothers. Going empty first causes their strong brothers to overrun their feeble sibling to the point where a high load can push the weak cell into reverse polarity. Nickel-cadmium can tolerate a reverse voltage of minus 0.2V at a few milliamps, but exceeding this will cause a permanent electrical short. On charge, the weak cell reaches full charge first, and then goes into heat-generating overcharge, while the strong brothers still accept charge and stay cool. The weak cell experiences a disadvantage on both charge and discharge; it continues to weaken until giving up the struggle.\nThe capacity tolerance between cells in an industrial battery should be +/– 2.5 percent. High-voltage packs designed for heavy loads and a wide temperature range should reduce the capacity tolerance further. There is a strong correlation between cell balance and longevity.\nFigure 1 illustrates the cycling performance of five aged Li-ion packs as a function of cell match. The cells are connected in a 2P4S arrangement with a center tap, forming two battery sections that in our example are poorly matched. The capacity differences between the two sections are 5, 6, 7 and 12 percent. When cycled, all batteries show large capacity losses over 18 cycles, but the greatest decrease occurs with the pack exhibiting 12 percent capacity mismatch.\nQuality Li-ion cells have uniform capacity and low self-discharge when new. Adding cell balancing is beneficial especially as the pack ages and the performance of each cell decreases at its own pace. A problem arises when a cell in a string loses capacity or develops elevated self-discharge. This can be attributed to high-temperature spots in a large battery. Low-quality cells may also be prone to unequal aging. Li-phosphate has higher self-discharge that other Li-ion, and this complicates cell balancing(See BU-802b: What does Elevated Self-discharge do?)\nA battery expert once said: “I have not seen a cell balancing circuit that works.” For multi-cell packs, he suggested using quality Li-ion cells that have been factory-sorted on capacity and voltage. This works well for Li-ion packs up to 24V; packs above 24V should have balancing. Most balancing is passive; active balancing is complex and is only used in very large systems.\nPassive balancing bleeds high-voltage cells on a resistor during charge in the 70–80 percent SoC curve; active balancing shuttles the extra charge from higher-voltage cells during discharge to those with a lower voltage. Active balancing is the preferred method for EV batteries, but it requires DC-DC converters. The corrected currents are in the mA range only. Applying a heavy load during acceleration, followed by rapid-charging with regenerative braking requires well-tuned cells in a high-voltage battery to attain the anticipated life. For cost reasons, EV batteries use mainly passive balancing.\nSingle-cell applications in mobile phones and tablets do not need cell balancing. The capacity between cells can vary and each cell is allowed to age on its own terms without causing harm, other than delivering shorter runtimes. The consumer accepts this decrease; it’s part of planned obsolescence in consumer products(See BU-801a: How to Rate Battery Runtime)\nAll Li-ion cells require a protection circuit that assures that serially connected cells do not exceed 4.25V/cell (most Li-ion) on charge and that disconnect when the weakest cell drops to 2.80V/cell or lower. The discharge disconnect prevents the stronger cells from pushing the depleted cell into reverse polarity. The protection circuit acts like a guardian angel that shields the weaker siblings from being bullied by the stronger peers. This may explain why Li-ion packs for power tools last longer than nickel-based batteries without a protection circuit. The protection circuit also safeguards the battery from excessive load current(See BU-304: Protection circuits)\nWith use and time, battery cells become mismatched, and this also applies to lead acid. Cells that develop high self-discharge will lead to imbalance and subsequent failure. Manufacturers of golf cars, aerial work platforms, floor scrubbers and other battery-powered vehicles recommend an equalizing charge if the voltage difference between the cells is greater than +/– 0.10V, or if the specific gravity varies more than 10 points (0.010 on the SG scale).\nAn equalizing charge is a charge on top of a charge that brings all cells to full-charge saturation. This service must be administered with care because excessive charging can harm the battery(See BU: 404: Equalizing Charge) A difference in specific gravity of 40 points poses a performance problem and the cell is considered defective. (A 40-point difference means one cell has an SG of 1.200 and another 1.240.) A charge may temporarily cover the deficiency, but the flaw will likely resurface again after a few hours due to the high self-discharge of the faulty cell.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-701-how-to-prime-batteries",
        "content": "In many ways, a battery behaves like a human being. It senses the kindness given and delivers on the care given. It is as if the battery has feelings and returns on the benevolence bestowed. But there are exceptions, as any parent raising a family will know; and the generosity conferred may not always deliver the anticipated returns.\nTo become a good custodian, you must understand the basic needs of a battery, a subject that is not taught in school. This section teaches what to do when the battery is new, how to feed it the right “food” and what to do when putting the pack aside for a while. Chapter 7 also looks into restrictions when traveling with batteries by air and how to dispose of them when their useful life has passed.\nJust as a person’s life expectancy cannot be predicted at birth, neither can we date stamp a battery. Some packs live to a great old age while others die young. Incorrect charging, harsh discharge loads and exposure to heat are the battery’s worst enemies. Although there are ways to protect a battery, the ideal situation is not always attainable. This chapter discusses how to get the most from our batteries.\nNot all rechargeable batteries deliver the rated capacity when new, and they require formatting. While this applies to most battery systems, manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries disagree. They say that Li-ion is ready at birth and does not need priming. Although this may be true, users have reported some capacity gains by cycling after a long storage.\n“What’s the difference between formatting and priming?” people ask. Both address capacities that are not optimized and can be improved with cycling. Formatting completes the fabrication process that occurs naturally during use when the battery is being cycled. A typical example is lead- and nickel-based batteries that improve with usage until fully formatted. Priming, on the other hand, is a conditioning cycle that is applied as a service to improve battery performance during usage or after prolonged storage. Priming relates mainly to nickel-based batteries.\nFormatting a lead acid battery occurs by applying a charge, followed by a discharge and recharge. This is done at the factory and is completed in the field as part of regular use. Experts advise not to strain a new battery by giving it heavy duty discharges at first but gradually working it in with moderate discharges, like an athlete trains for weight lifting or long-distance running. This, however, may not be possible with a starter battery in a vehicle and other uses. Lead acid typically reaches the full capacity potential after 50 to 100 cycles. Figure 1 illustrates the lifespan of lead acid.\nA new lead acid battery may not by fully formatted and only attains full performance after 50 or more cycles. Formatting occurs during use; deliberate cycling is not recommended as this would wear down the battery unnecessarily.\nDeep-cycle batteries are at about 85 percent when new and will increase to 100 percent, or close to full capacity, when fully formatted. There are some outliers that are as low as 65 percent when tested with a battery analyzer. The question is asked, “Will these low-performers recover and stand up to their stronger brothers when formatted?” A seasoned battery expert said that “these batteries will improve somewhat but they are the first to fail.”\nThe function of a starter battery lies in delivering high load currents to crank the engine, and this attribute is present from the beginning without the need to format and prime. To the surprise of many motorists, the capacity of a starter battery can fade to 30 percent and still crank the engine; however, a further drop may get the driver stranded one morning. See also BU-904: How to Measure Capacity)\nManufacturers advise to trickle charge a nickel-based battery for 16–24 hours when new and after a long storage. This allows the cells to adjust to each other and to bring them to an equal charge level. A slow charge also helps to redistribute the electrolyte to eliminate dry spots on the separator that might have developed by gravitation.\nNickel-based batteries are not always fully formatted when leaving the factory. Applying several charge/discharge cycles through normal use or with a battery analyzer completes the formatting process. The number of cycles required to attain full capacity differs between cell manufacturers. Quality cells perform to specification after 5–7 cycles, while lower-cost alternatives may need 50 or more cycles to reach acceptable capacity levels.\nLack of formatting causes a problem when the user expects a new battery to work at full capacity out of the box. Organizations using batteries for mission-critical applications should verify the performance through a discharge/charge cycle as part of quality control. The “prime” program of automated battery analyzers (Cadex) applies as many cycles as needed to attain full capacity.\nCycling also restores lost capacity when a nickel-based battery has been stored for a few months. Storage time, state-of-charge and temperature under which the battery is stored govern the ease of recovery. The longer the storage and the warmer the temperature, the more cycles will be required to regain full capacity. Battery analyzers help in the priming functions and assure that the desired capacity has been achieved.\nSome battery users insist that a passivation layer develops on the cathode of a lithium-ion cell after storage. Also known as interfacial protective film (IPF), this layer is said to restrict ion flow, cause an increase in internal resistance and in the worst case, lead to lithium plating. Charging, and more effectively cycling, is known to dissolve the layer and some battery users claim to have gained extra runtime after the second or third cycle on a smartphone, albeit by a small amount.\nScientists do not fully understand the nature of this layer, and the few published resources on this subject only speculate that performance restoration with cycling is connected to the removal of the passivation layer. Some scientists outright deny the existence of the IPF, saying that the idea is highly speculative and inconsistent with existing studies. Whatever the outcome on the passivation of Li-ion may be, there is no parallel to the “memory” effect with NiCd batteries that require periodic cycling to prevent capacity loss. The symptoms may appear similar but the mechanics are different. Nor can the effect be compared to sulfation of lead acid batteries.\nA well-known layer that builds up on the anode is the solid electrolyte solid electrolyte interface (SEI). SEI is an electrical insulation but has sufficient ionic conductivity to allow the battery to function normally. While the SEI layer lowers the capacity, it also protects the battery. Without SEI, Li-ion might not get the longevity that it has. (See BU-307: How does Electrolyte Work?)\nThe SEI layer develops as part of a formation process and manufacturers take great care to do this right, as a batched job can cause permanent capacity loss and a rise in internal resistance. The process includes several cycles, float charges at elevated temperatures and rest periods that can take many weeks to complete. This formation period also provides quality control and assists in cell matching, as well as observing self-discharge by measuring the cell voltage after a rest. High self-discharge hints to impurity as part of a potential manufacturing defect. Electrolyte oxidation (EO) also occurs on the cathode. This causes a permanent capacity loss and increases the internal resistance. No remedy exists to remove the layer once formed but electrolyte additives lessen the impact. Keeping Li-ion at a voltage above 4.10V/cell while at an elevated temperature promotes electrolyte oxidation. Field observation shows that the combination of heat and high voltage can stress Li-ion more than harsh cycling.Lithium-ion is a very clean system that does not need additional priming once it leaves the factory, nor does it require the level of maintenance that nickel-based batteries do. Additional formatting makes little difference because the maximum capacity is available right from the beginning, (the exception may be a small capacity gain after a long storage). A full discharge does not improve the capacity once the battery has faded — a low capacity signals the end of life. A discharge/charge may calibrate a “smart” battery but this does little to improve the chemical battery. (See BU-601: Inner Working of a Smart Battery.) Instructions recommending charging a new Li-ion for 8 hours are written off as “old school,” a left-over from the old nickel battery days.\nPrimary lithium batteries, such as lithium-thionyl chloride (LTC), benefit from passivation in storage. Passivation is a thin layer that forms as part of a reaction between the electrolyte, the lithium anode and the carbon-based cathode. (Note that the anode of a primary lithium battery is lithium and the cathode is graphite, the reverse of Li-ion.)\nWithout this layer, most lithium batteries could not function because the lithium would cause a rapid self-discharge and degrade the battery quickly. Battery scientists even say that the battery would explode without the formation of lithium chloride layers and that the passivation layer is responsible for the battery's existence and the ability to store for 10 years.\nTemperature and state-of-charge promote the buildup of the passivation layer. A fully charged LTC is harder to depassivate after long storage than one that was kept at a low charge. While LTC should be stored at cool temperatures, depassivation works better when warm as the increased thermal conductivity and mobility of the ions helps in the process.\nThe passivation layer causes a voltage delay when first applying a load to the battery, and Figure 2 illustrates the drop and recovery with batteries affected by different passivation levels. Battery A demonstrates a minimal voltage drop while Battery C needs time to recover.\nLTC in devices drawing very low current, such as a sensor for a road toll or metering, may develop a passivation layer that can lead to malfunction, and heat promotes such growth. This can often be solved by adding a large capacitor in parallel with the battery. The battery that has developed a high internal resistance is still capable of charging the capacitor to deliver the occasional high pulses; the standby time in between is devoted to recharging the capacitor.\nTo assist in sulfation prevention during storage, some lithium batteries are shipped with a 36kΩ resistor to serve as a parasitic load. The steady low discharge current prevents the layer from growing too thick, but this will reduce the storage life. After 2-year storage with the 36kΩ resistor, the batteries are said to still have 90 percent capacity. Another remedy is attaching a device that applies periodic discharge pulses during storage.\nNot all primary lithium batteries recover when installed in a device and when a load is applied. The current may be too low to reverse the passivation. It is also possible that the equipment rejects a passivated battery as being low state-of-charge or defective. Many of these batteries can be prepared with a battery analyzer (Cadex) by applying a controlled load. The analyzer then verifies proper function before engaging the battery in the field.\nThe required discharge current for depassivation is a C-rate of 1C to 3C (1 to 3 times of the rated capacity). The cell voltage must recover to 3.2V when applying the load; the service time is typically 20 seconds. The process can be repeated but it should take no longer than 5 minutes. With a load of 1C, the voltage of a correctly functioning cell should stay above 3.0V. A drop to below 2.7V means end-of-life. (See BU-106: Primary Batteries)\nThese lithium-metal batteries have high lithium content and must follow more stringent shipping requirements than Li-ion of the same Ah. (See BU-704a: Shipping Lithium-based Batteries by air) Because of the high specific energy, special care must be taken in handling these cells.\nWhen charging an SLA with over-voltage, current limiting must be applied to protect the battery. Always set the current limit to the lowest practical setting and observe the battery voltage and temperature during charge.\nIn case of rupture, leaking electrolyte or any other cause of exposure to the electrolyte, flush with water immediately. If eye exposure occurs, flush with water for 15 minutes and consult a physician immediately.\nWear approved gloves when touching the electrolyte, lead and cadmium. On exposure to the skin, flush with water immediately.\n[1] Courtesy EE Times\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Global production of Li-ion batteries was roughly 35 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2013; experts predict the demand will grow to 130GWh by 2020, a 3.7 fold increase. This presents a challenge as batteries need care in the hands of common users. Not enough attention is placed on battery diagnostics as part of work-force-to-retirement; most research goes into developing the super battery.\nThe capacity of a new battery is (should be) 100%. Lead acid batteries improve briefly with cycling, but all types begin the long gradual decline with usage and age. An analogy is an aging man reaching peak, but declining strength will eventual call for retirement. The condition of a battery should always be known. Device manufacturers tend to gloss over this issue; they wash their hands and wish the buyer good luck with the battery.\nA battery reaches peak and then declines like an aging man. Retirement procedures for batteries are often not clearly defined.\nCadex is developing Diagnostic Battery Management (DBM) in the form of an integrated system that manages and diagnoses batteries as part of workforce-to-retirement. The infrastructure includes a web-based application to store data and make battery performance transparent to the user and supervisor. The system comprises of battery chargers, analyzers and monitoring devices that update battery state-of-health (SoH) data with each service to maintain full historic information of the entire battery fleet.\nBatteries are often exposed to punitive stresses that include temperature extremes, vibration, harsh loads and fast charging and this applies especially to the electric vehicle (EV). Batteries must perform reliably when in the hands of casual and non-technical consumers.\nMany batteries are equipped with a battery management system (BMS) to control voltage and current. The BMS also shows state-of-charge (SoC) but provides little in SoH. This is where DBM takes over by estimating capacity to predict end of battery life. A DBM system can be expanded to also observe internal resistance to assure good power delivery, self-discharge to alert the user of a defect when excessive, and cell balance to protect individual cells from over-use when out of balance.\nAttention must be placed on battery aging, and Li-ion is of special concern. Not all batteries will retire quietly; some might depart with a bang; large units may need to be contained to prevent harm. A well-developed DBM cares for a battery alike a doctor who sets limits and raises caution when exceeded.Without diagnostics, device manufacturers often instruct to replace the battery on a date stamp. To cover most user patterns, a two-year replacement interval is common in healthcare. While this sells batteries, the practice is cost-prohibitive and burdens the environment.\nMedical technicians have discovered that the capacity of defibrillator batteries is commonly over 90% at expiry date. Good batteries are discarded prematurely and a manager of the Energy Storage Research Program at DOE reports that “every year roughly one million usable lithium-ion batteries are sent for recycling.”\nIn spite of this frivolous replacement policy, many batteries stay in service too long. A US FDA survey reported that “up to 50% of service calls in hospitals surveyed relate to battery issues.” Healthcare professionals at AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instruments) say that “battery management emerged as a top 10 medical device challenge.” A Bio-med Engineer states, “Batteries are the most abused components. Staff care little about them and only do the bare minimum. References to battery maintenance are vague and hidden inside service manuals.”\nBattery problems also occur in the military. A corporal serving in the Iraq war checked combat batteries with a voltmeter and marked the “good ones” with tape. Voltage measurement is inadequate because capacity is the leading health indicator. Without proper diagnostics, soldiers may carry rocks instead of batteries as Figure 2 suggests.\nIntegrating battery diagnostics into daily routines is the goal. DBM does this by verifying the battery capacity with each charge. With a database, the supervisor also gains access to enable logistics and budgeting. This prevents large quantities of batteries from being dumped into landfills due to of unknown status.\nBatteries should receive the same treatment as a critical part in a machine or aircraft where wear and tear falls under strict maintenance guidelines. This is seldom done with batteries for lack of suitable test technologies. Batteries are under-serviced and this is causing system failures under strain and during emergencies.\nBattery diagnostics have been lagging behind other technologies and efforts are being made to bring battery care into the 21st century. DBM can be seen as “dressing” a battery that otherwise would go bare. Isidor Buchmann, CEO and founder of Cadex and author of Battery University predicts an industrial revolution in batteries. He states that the time for battery diagnostics is now.\nDBM requires capturing the performance of a battery with each service, and this presents a roadblock. Most chargers only charge the battery and show “ready” even if the capacity is low. Cadex has made notable progress in rapid-testing, innovations that will form the building block for DBM. DBM-based products will include battery chargers, analyzers and hand-held testers with a web-based application Battery Embassy.\nBattery Embassy communicates over a line or by wireless connectivity with a central database to form the nucleus that connects to the DBM-operated products. Key markets are healthcare, defense, mobile communications, logistics, broadcast, power tools, automotive, mining, as well as as drones, robots and seismic devices. Figure 3 shows Battery Embassy communicating with an intelligent charger, analyzer, SOLI and Spectro™.\nSOLI stands for State-of-life Indicator that estimates battery life on delivered coulombs similar to the odometer in a car that reflects distance driven. Spectro™ is a rapid-tester based on Multi-model Electro-chemical Impedance Spectroscopy that scans a battery with a 20–2,000 Hertz signal creating a landscape. Complex modeling fuses the data to estimate battery capacity and CCA. Test time is 15 seconds.\nFCC measures in-and-out flowing coulombs. An analogy is filling a bottle with water in which the bottle size represents battery capacity and the in-and-out flowing water refers to the coulomb count. The FCC of a new battery is typically 100%; fading as part of capacity loss reflects in a lower reading because of shrinking container size.\nThe FCC data is stored in the SMBus battery. Available since the 1990s, SMBus stands for System Management Bus, which communicates to the outside world with a two-wire interface. SMBus batteries also include a digital serial number to assist in fleet management.\nThe FCC data is seldom used as a SoH indicator and the tracking error that develops with use may be to blame. DBM-based chargers and analyzers solve this drawback by requesting a calibration (not a fail) if the FCC reading falls below a user-set pass/fail threshold. Calibration applies a full charge and discharge cycle to measure the true “chemical” capacity and reset the FCC reading. A battery passes if the capacity is above the set threshold; a reading below marks the end of the battery.\nInserting a battery pack into a DBM-based charger or analyzer provides an instant SoH readout. Each service updates the central database to keep a complete history of the battery fleet. Come budget time, the operator simply calls up all packs with low capacity for replacement. Batteries in portable devices are normally replaced at 80%; UPS and traction batteries can often go to 70% or lower; starter batteries may drop to a capacity of as low as 40% before replacement becomes necessary.\nDBM can also verify the spare charge on batteries after a long day. An analogy is an airplane carrying extra fuel in anticipation of headwind and to enable a second landing approach. A battery should have a reserve charge of 10%. If the spare charge is always low on a spot check, the pass/fail threshold must be raised. If, on the other hand, plenty of reserve charge is on hand after a busy day, the capacity can drop to a lower threshold before replacement is necessary.\nKnowing battery capacity and spare charge reveals the energy consumption for each application. This enables risk management and reduced operational costs. Any calculations must also consider the “what-if.” This level of battery management is not done for lack of technology — DBM will change this.\nThe battery parser estimates battery capacity through the estimation of SoC. A parser-based charger or analyzer requires a onetime calibration for each battery model; cycling a good battery delivers this parameter that is stored in the appropriate battery adapters.\nFrom the user’s perspective, a parser-based charger offers the most simplistic and economical way to manage a battery as it estimates the capacity of regular (dumb) batteries during charge and provides quality control at no added logistics. The green “ready” light assures full charge and declares that the capacity requirements are met; a faded battery is shown the backdoor. Parser-based chargers also feature a display to show battery SoC and capacity in percentage and list any battery anomalies.\nSimplistic rapid-test methods are based on battery impedance (internal resistance), and as Figure 4 demonstrates resistance does not correlate well with capacity on Li-ion batteries. Improved electrolyte additives have reduced corrosion to keep the internal resistance low while the capacity declines predictably with cycle count. Internal resistance is further affected by SoC, falsifying SoH.\nLead acid batteries behave in a similar way to Li-ion in that resistive values stay low during normal usage (heat-damage is an exception). Nickel-based batteries show a rise in resistance with cycling and age, and here resistance readings can be useful.\nQuickSort 4 (QS4) uses Electrochemical Dynamic Response with Multi-dimensional Normalization to estimate the state of health of Li-ion batteries. Spectro™ (mentioned earlier) is based on the more complex Multi-model Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy that scans the battery with multiple frequencies. Both are proprietary Cadex technologies.\nThe full cycle applies a charge/discharge to read the capacity of the chemical battery; it also calibrates the smart battery to correct tracking errors between the chemical and digital battery. A full cycle is also used to prime and condition nickel-based batteries. Performed by a battery analyzer, this provides the most accurate capacity readings but the service is time consuming.\nAs the world moves from fossil fuel to stored electrical energy, the battery is being promoted as a green solution. This is a noble endeavor, but the battery has not yet matured to assume this important role. Pushing the boundaries exposes many limitations in being a “black box” with unpredictable service and a will of its own that quits at its own terms.\nDBM turns the battery into a reliable, safe, cost efficient and environmentally sustainable power source in which each pack can be utilized for its full life. Building a super battery is incomplete without including diagnostic features to predict end-of-life. DBM does this by combining known technologies into a powerful supervisory system. History is full of examples in which connecting known technologies produced powerful products that changed society. Just think of the invention of the Gutenberg press in circa 1440, the Internet and the smartphone.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "The global battery market is about $50 billion US, of which roughly $5.5 billion is allocated to rechargeable (secondary) batteries. The growth is estimated at 6% annually through 2006. China, India, Brazil, the Czech Republic and South Korea will record some of the strongest market gains. The Freedonia Group, Inc. predicts a US demand of primary and secondary batteries of $US 14 billion by the year 2007. A new generation of energy-hungry electronic devices, such as digital cameras, camera phones and high performance portable computing devices, will drive the growth. Figure 1 projects the consumption of primary and secondary batteries in the USA to the year 2012.\nFigure 1: Projected demand for batteries.Each incremental improvement of the battery opens the doors for new applicationsAlkaline will dominate the primary battery market. Others primary batteries will be lithium and zinc-air. Primary batteries can be stored up to 10 years and have much higher energy densities than secondary batteries. Figure 2 compares the predicted use of primary alkaline with other chemistries.\nFigure 2: Primary alkaline is leading the market. Other primary chemistries are expected to increase at a slower pace.Lead-acid will account for half the demand of rechargeables. This battery is mainly used for automotive and stand-by applications. Because of low cost and dependable service in adverse environmental conditions, lead-acid will enjoy a steady increase through to the year 2012. Lithium-based batteries may start to take over some lead-acid applications if the price can be lowered and the service life prolonged.The demand for lead acid batteries is governed by vehicle production. Battery replacements have decreased as new technologies have extended battery life by 6 months. With the switch to electronic braking and steering by wire in upscale cars, the 3kW capability of the single 12-volt battery will no longer be sufficient, ushering in the 42-volt system. Two 12-volt batteries may be the interim solution. Hybrid vehicles require a high voltage battery of about 150V, which is currently provided by connecting nickel-metal-hydride cells in series. Battery manufacturers are asked to provide a 8-10-year warranty to ensure that the battery will last for the life of the car. A replacement of the main battery would cost as much as installing a new motor.\nFigure 3: Lead-acid will be the most commonly used secondary battery. Among portable secondary batteries, lithium-ion shows the most promise.Lithium-ion will lead the demand in powering portable devices. The market for nickel-cadmium, on the other hand, is shrinking. This chemistry will be replaced with nickel-metal-hydride. Nickel-cadmium still holds a major share for power tools, two-way radios and medical devices. This chemistry is preferred over nickel-metal-hydride for its high durability and reliable service but some countries will ban its use by 2006 for environmental reasons. Exceptions will be made if the substitute is unsuitable. Little excitement is in store for alternative rechargeable batteries. If the predictions are correct, new chemistries will make up less than 7% of all secondary batteries. With no major breakthrough, the fuel cell will play an insignificant role in providing power for future applications. Cost, size and performance are the main obstacles. Although continuous in operation by replacing fuel capsules, the fuel cell, as we know it today, still needs a backup battery to satisfy the power requirements of modern portable equipment. By the look of things, the electro-chemical battery may keep its present position for some time to come. This puts the miracle battery to the back burner, a battery was supposed to power a laptop for days and enable heated clothing for North Pole expeditions.\nThe battery industry is becoming consolidated; competition will remain intense. The top Japanese suppliers held 80% of the market last year, but new contenders from other countries in Asia are making strong in-roads. BYD Battery Co. Ltd. in China is an example of a major new global battery producer. LG Electronics Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. in South Korea are following. These companies are gaining ground due to low pricing and improving quality. The price of lithium-ion batteries has dropped by 20-50% during the last few years. This prompts established battery manufacturers to shift production to lower-cost regions such as China. Nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal-hydride batteries are not immune to price declines. Prices have dropped by 10-20%. The USA and Europe will continue to produce specialty batteries, mainly used for defense and industrial applications. In comparison to the mass-produced batteries from Asia, American and European packs will be more expensive.\nThe following graphs are collected from various sources as compiled by BMZ, Germany, www.bmz-gmbh.de.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/green-deal",
        "content": "The oil industry anticipates a quick recovery in oil consumption with records exceeding 100,000 million barrels per day. This burn-rate troubles environmentalists because of global warming caused by a rise of carbon dioxide (CO2). In pre-industrial times, CO2 was below 280 parts per million. Since 1970, atmospheric CO2 levels have risen rapidly and now exceed 400.\nAtmospheric conditions on earth are critical for the well-being of life. Slight fluctuations have significant effects. Consider that a 23° tilt in the earth’s axis causes temperature fluctuations from -40°C to +40°C (-40F to 104°F) in some parts of the world. A further increase in CO2 will amplify the extremes in the form of weather patterns that include floods and droughts. Large volcanic eruptions have extinguished lives in the past for a time — burning 100,000 million barrels of oil a day is manmade and continuous.\nCitizens in the wealthy West blame governments for inaction while enjoying the convenience of cheap fossil fuel. No one likes changes. When the medical associations in the 1970s realized that smoking tobacco is harmful to human health, the then US president Ronald Reagan said, “Yes, we must do everything to cut down on smoking. But let’s not hurt the tobacco industry” (paraphrased). Applied today, a politically correct solution is driving an electric vehicle (EV) subsidized by taxpayers.\nEurope has been more frugal in fossil fuel consumption than North America. As a guideline, North America burns roughly twice the amount of fossil fuel per capita than Europe. Much of this freewheeling consumption rests on promoting the car culture and helping oil industries. Endorsing the EV is less a consumer trend than political pressure. But is this the end-all solution, we ask?\nA 2019 study by ADAC*, Germany, and Joanneum Research, Austria, reveals that manufacturing an EV generates more CO2 than a vehicle with an internal combustion engine (ICE). According to a research fellow at the Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, generating 1kWh of electricity by coal produces 1kg of CO2, similar to driving 6km (3.75 miles) in a luxury car. Manufacturing a 1kWh Li-ion produces 75kg of CO2, the same as burning 35 liters (7.7 gallons) of gasoline.\nTable 1 compares the CO2 emitted manufacturing and driving vehicles with a diesel engine versus an electric powertrain.\nBased on higher CO2 emissions building an EV versus a vehicle with ICE, the EV needs to drive 225,000km to break even with a diesel-powered vehicle. (Volkswagen marks this odometer reading as the end-of-life of a car.) Labeling EV zero-emission is incorrect because in most regions electricity is generated by fossil fuel. Producing 1kWh of electricity by coal produces 0.94kg (2 lbs) of CO2.\nUnless electricity can be produced from renewable resources, the EV does not provide the expected solution to CO2 reduction. A compromise is a mild hybrid with a small ICE and a 48V battery that reduces fuel consumption by up to 40%. A plug-in hybrid would provide most daily commuting by battery power. Focus should be on vehicle size and weight. A full-size EV battery weighs 500kg (1,100 lb) and represents 40% of the vehicle cost.\nThe planned CO2 reductions by 2050 may not be feasible or affordable with today’s technologies. Changing road transport from fossil fuel to electric is expected to double electric energy demand; however EVs can be charged at night during low usage. Most houses are also heated with natural gas that generates CO2. Changing to electrical heat will further stress the electrical grid. Because of high calorific value, air travel will continue to rely on fossil fuel.\nTo meet future electrical demands with EVs, renewable energy and battery backup are added to the grid. This tri-state system of a steady resource, renewables and battery backup must be designed to sustain worst-case conditions when renewable energy is non-existent. Batteries only provide shortterm energy supply and perform poorly at low temperatures. We also include high costs. Energy delivered by a battery doubles the cost of a kWh. Generating electricity by renewable energy is more expensive than fossil fuel or nuclear.\nRenewable energy is sporadic and excess may one day be stored in hydrogen to power fuel cells. A more common energy storage system is pumped hydro in which excess water is pumped into an elevated reservoir for later use. Flywheels and supercapacitors will provide short-term power to ultrafast charge EVs in regions not supported by a high power grid. Typical users will be hotels and motels.\nConclusion\nEurope is aware of the energy footprint and participates in energy saving, a less popular hobby in North America. Careless use of precious energy is visible in private transportation. Commuting to work could be solved with rapid transit systems in which commuter gets the morning exercise by traveling to the train station by light mobility in the form of a bike or scooter. America has no high-speed rail. With fast rail service, people could live in smaller towns and commute to city centers by train. Such infrastructure would not only lower CO2 emissions but also decrease the cost-ofliving. Europe and Asia are ahead of North America in modern transportation systems. Switching to the EV is not the end-all solution and government subsidies should go towards public transportation.\nReference:\nPresentation by Hans-Werner Sinn at VHS Erding, Munich (2021)\nStudy ADAC with Joanneum Research in Graz, Austria (2019)\n* ADAC is an acronym for Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club; General German Automobile Club.

        "content": "Li-ion batteries contain a protection circuit that shields the battery against abuse. This important safeguard also turns the battery off and makes it unusable if over-discharged. Slipping into sleep mode can happen when storing a Li-ion pack in a discharged state for any length of time as self-discharge would gradually deplete the remaining charge. Depending on the manufacturer, the protection circuit of a Li-ion cuts off between 2.2 and 2.9V/cell(See BU-802b: Elevated Self-discharge)\nSome battery chargers and analyzers (including Cadex), feature a wake-up feature or “boost” to reactivate and recharge batteries that have fallen asleep. Without this provision, a charger renders these batteries unserviceable and the packs would be discarded. Boost applies a small charge current to activate the protection circuit and if a correct cell voltage can be reached, the charger starts a normal charge. Figure 1 illustrates the “boost” function graphically.\nSome over-discharged batteries can be “boosted” to life again. Discard the pack if the voltage does not rise to a normal level within a minute while on boost.\nDo not boost lithium-based batteries back to life that have dwelled below 1.5V/cell for a week or longer. Copper shunts may have formed inside the cells that can lead to a partial or total electrical short. When recharging, such a cell might become unstable, causing excessive heat or show other anomalies. The Cadex “boost” function halts the charge if the voltage does not rise normally.\nWhen boosting a battery, assure correct polarity. Advanced chargers and battery analyzers will not service a battery if placed in reverse polarity. A sleeping Li-ion does not reveal the voltage, and boosting must be done with awareness. Li-ion is more delicate than other systems and a voltage applied in reverse can cause permanent damage.\nStoring lithium-ion batteries presents some uncertainty. On one end, manufacturers recommend keeping them at a state-of-charge of 40–50 percent, and on the other end there is the worry of losing them due to over-discharge(See BU-702: How to Store Batteries) There is ample bandwidth between these criteria and if in doubt, keep the battery at a higher charge in a cool place.\nCadex examined 294 mobile phones batteries that were returned under warranty. The Cadex analyzer restored 91 percent to a capacity of 80 percent and higher; 30 percent were inactive and needed a boost, and 9 percent were non-serviceable. All restored packs were returned to service and performed flawlessly. This study shows the large number of mobile phone batteries that fail due to over-discharging and can be salvaged.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-414-how-do-charger-chips-work",
        "content": "When first introduced in the 1980s, charger chips simplified the design of NiCd and NiMH chargers as batteries with these chemistries were difficult to charge. Li-ion is simpler and most modern charging chips also include the protection circuits that are needed to safe charge Li-ion. These include current and voltage regulation, FET switches and may also contain charge status indicators and cell balancing. Added to most chips is a time-out-timer that halts charge if predictable symptoms do not occur as expected when charging a flawed battery.\nAdvanced chips also feature pre-charge conditioning (boost) to wake up an inactive battery, as well as a sleep mode that lowers the housekeeping current of the circuit while the battery is in storage. Some chips also initiate a charge if a parasitic load lowers the battery voltage below a preset threshold while residing in a charger.\nAlthough charger chips are easy and economical to use, they have limitations. Most offer a fixed charge algorithm that does not permit fine-tuning for specialty uses. Chips are made for a given battery and may not accommodate different chemistries as requested by the user or read a battery code that may be embedded in a battery holder. Nor do most chips adjust to an optimal charge current when charging an aging battery with reduced charge acceptance.\nMicrocontrollers offer an alternative to charger chips. Although the design cost is higher because of the extra programming time needed, manufacturing costs are compatible to charger chips. It should be noted that the charge chip or the microcontroller only form a small part of the charger circuit; the bulk of the cost lies in the peripheral components, which include solid-state switches, signal lights and the power supply. The parts cost is directly related to wattage.\nFactory-configured charger modules are available that are set to the correct voltage, current and algorithm. Some have seamless DC-DC conversion to allow charging a battery with a higher voltage than the input provides. Options include SMBus, solar charging, discharge for calibration and display. Using soft-programmable charger modules resembles the ready-made AC power supplies that became popular in the 1990s as a lower-cost alternative to building one’s own charger for each application.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/examining-loading-characteristics-on-primary-and-secondary-batteries",
        "content": "Rechargeable batteries are gaining such high media attention that some consider non-rechargeables as old technology. Primaries still play an important role, especially when charging is impractical or impossible such as in military combat, rescue missions and forest-fire services. Other applications for primaries are pacemakers for heart patients, tire pressure gauges in cars and trucks, transmitters for bird tracking, intelligent drill bits in mining, light beacons in oceans, not to forget our wristwatches, remote controls, electric keys and children’s toys. High specific energy, long storage times and instant readiness give the primary battery a unique advantage over other power sources. Primary batteries are generally inexpensive, readily available and environmentally friendly.\nCarbon-zinc, also known as the Leclanché battery, is one of the least expensive primary batteries and often comes with consumer devices when the batteries are included. Alkaline-manganese, known as Alkaline, is an improved version of the old carbon-zinc. Lewis Urry invented it in 1949 while working with the Eveready Battery Company Laboratory in Parma, Ohio. Alkaline delivers more energy at higher load currents than carbon-zinc and does not leak when depleted, although it is not totally leak-proof. A discharging Alkaline generates hydroxide gases. Pressure buildup can rupture the seal and cause corrosion in form of a feathery crystalline structure that can spread to neighboring parts and cause damage. All primary batteries produce gas on discharge and the portable device must have provision for venting.\nLithium Iron Disulfide (Li-FeS2) is a newcomer to the primary battery family and offers improved performance. Lithium batteries normally deliver 3 volts and higher, but Li-FeS2 produces 1.5 volts to be compatible with the AA and AAA formats. It has a higher capacity and a lower internal resistance than Alkaline. This enables moderate to heavy loads and is ideal for digital cameras. Further advantages are improved low temperature performance, superior leakage resistance and low self-discharge, allowing 15 years of storage at ambient temperatures. Low weight and minimal toxicity are added benefits.\nThe disadvantages of the Li-FeS2 are a higher price and transportation issues because of the lithium metal content in the anode. This causes restriction in air shipment. In 2004, the US DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) banned bulk shipments of primary lithium batteries on passenger flights, but airline passengers can still carry them on board or in checked bags. Each AA-sized Li-FeS2 contains 0.98 grams of lithium; the air limitation of primary lithium batteries is 2 grams (8 grams for rechargeable Li-ion). This restricts each passenger to two cells but exceptions have been made in which 12 sample batteries can be carried. Read more about How to Transport Batteries.\nThe Li-FeS2 includes safety devices in the form of a resettable PTC thermal switch that limits the current at high temperature. The Li-FeS2 cell cannot be recharged as is possible with NiMH in the AA and AAA formats. Recharging, putting in a cell backwards or mixing with used or other battery types could cause a leak or explosion. Read more about Safety Concerns with Li-ion.\nFigures 1 and 2 compare the discharge voltage and internal resistance of Alkaline and Li-FeS2 at a 50mA pulsed load. Of interest is the flat voltage curve and the low internal resistance of Lithium; Alkaline shows a gradual voltage drop and a permanent increase in resistance with use. This shortens the runtime, especially at an elevated load.\nFigure 1: Voltage and internal resistance of alkaline on discharge. The voltage drops rapidly and causes the internal resistance to rise\nFigure 2: Voltage and internal resistance of Lithium on discharge. The voltage curve is flat and the internal resistance stays low\nCourtesy of Energizer\nThe AA and AAA are the most common cell formats. Known as penlight batteries for pocket lights, the AA became available to the public in 1915 and was used as a spy tool during World War I; the American National Standard Institute standardized the format in 1947. The AAA was developed in 1954 to reduce the size of the Kodak and Polaroid cameras and shrink other portable devices. In the 1990s, an offshoot of the 9V battery produced the AAAA for laser pointers, LED penlights, computer styli, and headphone amplifiers.

The capacity on the AA is double that of the AAA at similar price, making the energy storage on the AAA twice than of the AA.\n* In mAh; discharge current is less than 500mA; ** estimated prices in $US (2012)\nThe AAA cell contains roughly half the capacity of the larger AA at a similar price. In essence, the energy cost of the AAA is twice that of the AA. In an effort to downsize, energy cost often takes second stage and device manufacturers prefer using the smaller AAA over the larger AA. This is the case with bicycle lights where the AA format would only increase the device slightly but deliver twice the energy for the same battery expense. Proper design considerations contribute protecting the environment.\nRetail prices of the Alkaline AA vary, so does performance. Exponent, a US engineering firm, checked the capacity of eight brand-name Alkaline batteries in AA packages and discovered a discrepancy between the best and lowest performers of 800 percent. An easy gauge to test batteries is counting the shots a digital camera can take with a set of cells. The elevated current of the digital camera stresses the battery more than a remote control or a kitchen clock would. When a regular Alkaline stops functioning in a digital camera, the remaining energy can still power a remote control and run a kitchen clock for up to two years.\nFigure 4 illustrates the number of shots a digital camera can take with discharge pulses of 1.3 watts on Alkaline, NiMH and Lithium Li-FeS2 in AA packages. (With two cells in series at 3V, 1.3W draws 433mA.) Although the three battery chemistries tested have similar capacities, the results vary largely. The clear winner is Li-FeS2 with 690 pulses; the second is NiMH with 520 pulses and the distant third is standard Alkaline producing only 85 pules. Internal resistance rather than capacity governs the shot count.\nFigure 4: Number of shots a digital camera can take with Alkaline NiMH and Lithium\nLi-FeS2, NiMH and Alkaline have similar capacities; the internal resistance governs the shot count on a digital camera.\nLi-FeS2, 3Ah, 690 pulsesNiMH, 2.5Ah, 520 pulsesAlkaline, 3Ah, 85 pulses\nTest: ANSI C18.1\nCourtesy of Exponent\nThe rated capacity as a performance indicator is most useful at low discharge currents; at higher loads the power factor begins to play an important role. The relationship between capacity and the ability to deliver current can best be illustrated with the Ragone Chart. Named after David V. Ragone, the Ragone chart evaluates an energy storage device on energy and power. Energy in Ah presents the available storage capacity of a battery and is responsible for the runtime; power in watts governs the load current. These two attributes are important for digital applications that require long runtimes but must also accommodate current pulses. The Ragone chart can be moved up and down depending on power demands.\nFigure 5 illustrates the Ragone chart with the 1.3W load of a digital camera using Lithium (Li-FeS2), NiMH and Alkaline. The horizontal axis displays energy in Watt/hours and the vertical axis provides power in Watts. The scale is logarithmic to allow a wide selection of battery sizes.\nFigure 5: Ragone chart illustrates battery performance with various load conditions.\nDigital camera loads NiMH, Li-FeS2 and Alkaline with 1.3W pulses according to ANSI C18.1 (dotted line). The results are:\n- Li- FeS2 690 pluses- NiMH 520 pulses- Alkaline 85 pulses\nEnergy = Capacity x VPower = Current x V\nCourtesy of Exponent\nThe performance of the battery chemistries varies according to the position of the Ragone line. NiMH delivers the highest power but has the lowest specific energy and works well at high loads such as power tools. The Lithium Li-FeS2 has the highest specific energy and satisfies moderate loading conditions, such as digital cameras, medical instruments and similar portable devices. Alkaline offers an economic solution for lower current drains such as flashlights, remote controls and wall clocks.\nReferences\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "The market offers a wide choice of battery testers, all providing correct predictions when the battery is dead, but so does the user. The challenge is tracking the capacity of a working battery that is in normal use but will eventually need replacement.Most testers measure voltage and internal resistance, also known as impedance, but capacity estimation is beyond reach. In spite of this limitation, some makers of battery testers promote the ability to estimate capacity. This confuses the industry into believing that multifaceted results can be attained with basic impedance methods. The term “capacity” as energy storage capability is not always clearly understood. Battery rapid-testing was easier in the past. Early testers simply measured the internal resistance of a battery that increased with age. Modern batteries have improved and the one-size-fits-all approach no longer applies. Electrolyte additives and advancements in electrode materials have reduce corrosion and the resistance stays low through most the battery life. These improvements apply to lithium-ion and lead acid batteries.Figure 1 shows the relationship between capacity and internal resistance of modern Li-ion batteries as a function of cycle count. The batteries tested reflect a predictable capacity drop while the resistance stays low throughout most of the service life. Older batteries would have shown a pronounced rise in resistance and likely cross the capacity line, forming the letter ”X.”\nImprovements in battery technology have not eliminated the gradual loss of capacity and batteries have a defined life span. This also reflects in the auto industry, especially in starter batteries. The short lifespan is mostly caused by the start-stop function and energy-robbing auxiliary loads of modern cars. ADAC road assistance in Germany says that 42 percent of all vehicle breakdowns are battery related. According to the ADAC 2013 report, problems with starter battery have risen four times between 1996 and 2010. The report states that each third breakdown involves a discharged or defective battery and that few packs reach the age of five years. (ADAC stands for Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club, a German automobile club founded in 1903.)Checking the capacity by discharging a fully charged battery would provide the most reliable estimation but this is impractical for larger systems and requires removing the battery from service. There is also the stress factor. A lead acid permanently loses roughly two percent of its capacity with each full cycle. A starter battery is made for short deliveries of high current and loses as much as eight percent when fully discharged. Starter batteries should not be deep-cycled.A luxury German carmaker reports that half of all batteries replaced under warranty exhibited no fault. A leading battery maker states that only 5 to 7 percent of warranty batteries have a factory fault. This implies that most failures are user-induced and a replacement could be prevented. Japan says that battery breakdown is the largest single complaint by new car owners. Starter batteries in gridlocked traffic do not always receive sufficient charge and fail because of sulfation at no fault to the manufacturer.A battery that cranks the engine well does not always relate to good health. This gives the motorists a false sense of security by assuming that all is well. Capacity determines the health but this value is difficult to measure on the fly. Not knowing the capacity causes many batteries to be changed too soon, but most are replaced too late.Most testers for automotive batteries measure cold cranking amp (CCA). CCA relates to internal resistance that tends to stay high while the capacity drops in a linear and predictable way with use and age. CCA reading could indeed predict state-of-health on older batteries to some degree but this is no longer accurate with the improvements. Cadex tested 175 aging starter batteries and found that the correlation between CCA and capacity is only 0.55. A perfect match would be 1. Basing battery SoH on CCA is alike tossing a coin.Battery rapid-testing is developing on several fronts and involves time domain with discharge pulses and frequency domain with frequency scans. Cadex developed Electrochemical Dynamic Response (EDR) to check small Li-ion cells by observing voltage recovery on applied small pulses. A fast recovery denotes good ion flow; a sluggish reaction indicates capacity loss. An analogy is a dried-out felt pen that still writes but needs rest to replenish the ink. Some older battery may also show elevated voltage deflection due to higher internal resistance and EDR evaluates this also. Figure 2 compares a good battery with quick recovery against a faded one with a sluggish response.\nEDR is superior to the rudimentary pulse method in that it can estimate SoH of Li-ion, but the technology is ill-suited for larger batteries. EDR is also sensitive to the choice of electrolytes and cathode materials. This drawback can be solved by characterizing a battery, but the test becomes battery specific, requiring so-called look-up tables that must be derived from batteries with various performance levels.Technologies using frequency domain are mostly based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Scientists believe that the future of battery rapid-testing is in EIS. The battery is scanned with a frequency from less than one Hertz to several kilohertz. High frequency reveals resistive qualities, also known as bird-eye view, but the unique characteristics of a battery are hidden in the low frequencies.Cadex advanced EIS further and developed multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, or Spectro™ for short. The battery is scanned to produce a Nyquist plot that characterizes the individual components of the Randles model. Randles breaks the battery it down to ohmic and reactive components. Electrochemical models, or matrices, are then fitted to estimate capacity and CCA values, calculations that involve 40 million transactions to derive at the end result. Spectro™ and its matrices are similar to devices that read letters, fingerprints, eye retinas and facial features.Spectro™ can operate on a battery-specific or generic matrix. Both are created by scanning several batteries of different performance levels. The battery-specific matrices have the advantage of displaying the capacity in a numeric readout (percent of the full capacity). The generic matrix may include a group of starter batteries ranging from 40–100Ah and offers the result in a pass/fail classification. Many service personnel appreciate this method as it present a clear yes/no assessment and eliminates customer interference.The Spectro™ technology is embedded in the Spectro CA-12, a handheld battery tester that estimates the capacity and CCA in less than 30 seconds noninvasively. The battery must have a minimal charge of 60 percent. Best results are attained by testing a “working” battery taken from regular service. New batteries that lack formatting, or packs that had been in prolonged storage, may not exhibit the same symptoms.Another promising application to estimate capacity is integrating the Spectro™ technology in a Battery Management System (BMS). Standby batteries are often installed and forgotten. Voltage and impedance readings cannot estimate the capacity and very few large batteries are discharged for the purpose of verifying sufficient energy storage. A capacity-estimating BMS can tell the user when to replace a battery.Technologies measuring battery state-of-health can also be integrated into a battery charger. Such a system will not only charge a battery but also assure that the pack delivers a capacity of 80 to 100 percent when the ready light illuminates. Health validation in a charger provides quality control at no extra effort and tells the fleet managers when to show faded packs the exit door.Summary Batteries do not exhibit visible changes as they wear down and age; they look the same when fully charged or empty, new or old and in need of replacement. A car tire, in comparison, distorts when low on air and indicates end-of-life when the treads are worn.Batteries should receive the same treatment as a critical part in an aircraft, medical device or industrial machine where wear-and-tear falls under strict maintenance guidelines. Authorities struggle to implement such a procedure for batteries; lack of suitable test technology makes this difficult. Bad batteries can hide and enjoy immunity among the peers. New technologies being developed will eventually invade the long-held exclusive status and making batteries accountable.

        "content": "With the large number of lithium-ion batteries in use and the applications growing, a functional rapid-testing method is becoming a necessity. Several attempts have been tried, including measuring internal resistance, and the results have been mixed. Additives keep the internal resistance of modern Li-ion low throughout most of the life, making ohmic test unreliable. The internal resistance is measured either by the AC or DC method. Both provide different reading(See BU-802a: How does Rising Internal Resistance affect Performance?)\nElectrochemical dynamic response, the method QuickSort™ uses, measures the mobility of ion flow between the electrodes. Based on time domain analysis by applying brief load pulses, the response time on attack and recovery is measured; an algorithm computes the results and compares them against a set of parameters. As seen in Figure 1, a good battery resists the attack and recovers quickly whereas the impact of a weaker battery is larger and the recovery is slower. Figure 1 illustrates the concept of the technology.\nThe electrochemical dynamic response measures the ion flow between the positive and negative plates. A strong battery recovers quickly from an attack whereas a weaker pack behaves more sluggishly.\nLithium-ion batteries have different diffusion rates. In terms of electrochemical dynamic response, Li-ion polymer with gelled electrolyte is found to be faster than standard Li-ion and needs modified parameters to achieve accuracy. Unique active materials and additives that are kept top secret by battery manufacturers complicate the test procedure.\nCadex devoted much effort to testing small single Li-ion cell in mobile phones. The objective is to also test larger Li-ion in multi-cell configuration, over a broad range of state-of-charge, which involves combining time domain test with frequency domain.\nWhen scanning a battery from kilohertz down to millihertz in frequency domain mode, the high frequency range called migration reveals the resistive qualities of a battery that present a bird’s-eye view of the landscape. However, the unique characteristics of Li-ion lie in the mid frequency range called charge transfer and the low range dubbed diffusion. Batteries with faded capacity suffer from low charge transfer and slow active Li-ion diffusion.\nEvaluating batteries at sub one-hertz frequency would require prolonged test times. At one millihertz, for example, one cycle takes 1,000 seconds, or 16 minutes, and several data points are required to complete the analysis. Rapid-tests should only last a few seconds and not longer than 5 minutes. With clever software simulation, the duration can be shortened to fall within the desired short test time.\nIn Figure 2, a good battery and a faded battery are scanned from 0.1Hz to 1kHz. The difference in impedance (-Imp -Z) is strongest between 1Hz and 10Hz. It should be noted that capturing resistive readings alone has limited value as state-of-charge (SoC) and temperature also affect the signature and muddle SoH references. Furthermore, different Li-ion architectures and how the battery has aged also affect the results. Natural aging produces a different signature than artificial aging and the reason for this discrepancy is not fully understood.\nImpedance variances are most visible below 10Hz. The horizontal scale is logarithmic to condense the frequency range.\nTest results captured by frequency domain are best represented by the Nyquist plot. Invented by Harry Nyquist (1889–1976) while at Bell Laboratories; a Nyquist plot presents the frequency response of a linear systems displaying both amplitude and phase angle on a single plot using frequency as parameter. The horizontal x axis of a Nyquist plot reveals the real Ohm impedance while the vertical y axis represents the imaginary impedance(Impedance is explained on BU-902: How to Measure Internal Resistance)\nFigure 3 divides the scanned battery results as delivered by the Nyquist plot into migration, charge transfer and diffusion. Migration derived at high frequency on the left provides resistive characteristics of a battery; the all-important charge transfer in the middle forms a semi-circle that represents the kinetics of the battery; and the low frequency part on the right represents diffusion.\nThe mid-frequency semi-circle represents battery characteristics best. Larger batteries require lower frequencies.\nA rapid-test should last from a few seconds to no more than 5 minutes, but applying ultra-low frequencies prolongs time. For example, at one millihertz (mHz), one cycle takes 1,000 seconds, or 16 minutes, and several data points are required to complete the analysis. Test durations can often be shortened with clever software simulation.\nLi-ion shares similarities with lead acid; the Spectro™ technology that is used to measure the capacity of lead acid batteries will also be able to service Li-ion(See BU-904: How to Measure Capacity)\nNo rapid-test can evaluate all battery symptoms and there are always outliers that defy the test protocol. Correct prediction should be 9 out of 10. QuickSort™ (by Cadex) exceeds this requirement with most Li-ion packs for mobile phones, but this technology only tests single-cell packs up to 1,500mAh. New technologies in development promise to test larger Li-ion packs, but this may extend the test to a few minutes to accommodate low frequency sampling.\nCapacity is the gate keeper to battery health, and rapid-test technologies with capacity estimation also enhance battery management systems (BMS). Such rapid-test technologies can be included in chargers to evaluate the integrity of the battery with each charge by giving the green ready light only if the set target capacity is met; low capacity batteries are shown the backdoor. This provides quality control without adding an extra layer of overhead.\n[1] J. Tinnemeyer and Z. Carlin, \"Pulse-discharge battery testing methods and apparatus\".

        "content": "Transformation from the horse-drawn carriage to horseless transportation took its time when new technology arrived. The architecture and seating arrangements stayed the same for a while on early cars; only the horse was replaced with a motor. Figure 1 illustrates proud and well-to-do travelers on a horseless carriage, well elevated from the danger of horse’s hoofs and the grit from the street.\nIn the early 1900s, the electric vehicle was reserved for dignitaries the likes of Thomas Edison, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and Clara Ford, the wife of Henry Ford. They chose this transportation for its quiet ride over the vibrating and polluting internal combustion engine. Environmentally conscious drivers are rediscovering the EV with a choice of many attractive products.\nThe EV culture is developing distinct philosophies, each satisfying a unique user group. This is visible with vehicle sizes and the associated batteries. The subcompact EV comes with a battery that has 12–18kWh, the mid-sized family sedan has a 22–32kWh pack, and the luxury models by Tesla stand alone with an oversized battery boasting 60–100kWh to provide extended driving range and achieve high performance.\nThe EV is said to replace cars with the internal combustion engine (ICE) by ca. 2040. Several technological improvements will be needed to make the electric powertrain practical and economical. Even with oil at $100 a barrel, the price of the EV batteries would need to fall by a factor of three and also offer ultra-fast charging. In terms of carbon footprint, the electricity used to power the EVs would need to come from renewable sources. Published reports say that emissions from EVs powered by America’s electricity grids are higher than those from an efficient ICE. Table 2 illustrates common EVs.\n* In 2015/16 Tesla S 85 increased the battery from 85kWh to 90kWh; Nissan Leaf from 25kWh to 30kWh.\nThe makers of Nissan Leaf, BMW i3 and other EVs use the proven lithium-manganese (LMO)battery with a NMC blend, packaged in a prismatic cell. (NMC stands for nickel, manganese, cobalt.) Tesla uses NCA (nickel, cobalt, aluminum) in the 18650 cell that delivers an impressive specific energy of 3.4Ah per cell or 248Wh/kg. To protect the delicate Li-ion from over-loading at highway speed, Tesla over-sizes the pack by a magnitude of three to four fold compared to other EVs.\nThe large 90kWh battery of the Tesla S Model (2015) provides an unparalleled driving range of 424km (265 miles), but the battery weighs 540kg (1,200 lb), and this increases the energy consumption to 238Wh/km (380Wh/mile), one of the highest among EVs(See BU-1005: Fuel Cell Vehicle)\nIn comparison, the BMW i3 is one of the lightest EVs and has a low energy consumption of 160Wh/km (260Wh/mile). The car uses an LMO/NMC battery that offers a moderate specific energy of 120Wh/kg but is very rugged. The mid-sized 22kWh pack provides a driving range of 130–160km (80–100 miles). To compensate for the shorter range, the i3 offers REX, an optional gasoline engine that is fitted on the back. Table 3 compares the battery size and energy consumption of common EVs. The range is under normal non-optimized driving conditions.\n* Driving range limited to 28kWh; manual switch to 31.5kWh gives extra 16km (10 mile) spare\nClarification: The driving ranges in Tables 2 and 3 differ. This is less of an error than applying different driving conditions. Discrepancies also occur in topping charge, depth of discharge and fuel-gauging.\nNote: Driving ranges are based on short duration and low speed. Stated distances per charge under true driving conditions are typical at 65%.\nThe cost of automotive lithium-ion batterers has fallen from about $1,000/kWh to a bit more than $100/kWh today. These cost reductions are attributed to incremental improvements in battery design and manufacturing efficiency, but few are credited to better battery chemistry. To further reduce cost, better battery chemistries are needed, but nothing is in the foreseeable future for the EV at time of writing.\nIn ca. 2016, the cost of an EV battery was about $350/kWh. Tesla managed to lower the price to $250/kWh using the 18650, a popular cell of which 2.5 billion were made in 2013. The 18650 in the current Tesla models is an unlikely choice as the cell was designed for portable devices such as laptops. Available since the early 1990s, the 18650 cell is readily available at a low cost. The cylindrical cell-design further offers superior stability over the prismatic and pouch cell, but the advantage may not hold forever as prismatic and pouch cells are improving. Large Li-ion cells are relatively new and have the potential for higher capacities and lower pack-cost as fewer cells are needed.\nPrices are dropping and Bloomberg (December 2017) says that the average EV battery costs now $209 per kWh. This includes housings, wiring, BMS and plumbing, housekeeping that adds 20 percent to 40 percent to cell costs. Experts predict that the EV battery will drop below $100 per kWh by 2025. This will put the EV in par with a conventional powered vehicle of similar features. These price reductions do not apply to stationary battery systems that, according to Bloomberg, will command a 51 percent price premium over the EV because of lower volume.\nAll EV makers must provide an 8-year warranty or a mileage limit on their batteries. Tesla believes in their battery and offers 8 years with unlimited mileage. Figure 4 illustrates the battery that forms the chassis of the Tesla S Model. The Model S 85 contains 7,616 type 18650 cells in serial and parallel configuration. The smaller S-60 has 5,376 cells.\nThe 85kWh battery has 7,616 18650 cells in parallel/serial configuration. At $250 per kWh, the cost is lower than other Li-ion designs.\nEV manufacturers calculate the driving range under the best conditions and according to reports, the distances traveled in the real-world can be 30–37 percent less than advertised. This may be due to the extra electrical loads such as headlights, windshield wipers, as well as cabin heating and cooling. Aggressive driving in a hilly countryside lowers the driving range further.\nCold temperature also reduces the driving range. What battery users may also overlook is the difficulty of charging when cold. Most Li-ion cannot be charged below freezing. To protect EV batteries, some packs include a heating blanket to warm the battery during cold temperature charging. A BMS may also administer a lower charge current when the battery is cold. Fast charging when cold promotes dendrite growth in Li-ion that can compromise battery safety(See BU-410: Charging at High and Low Temperature)\nEV owners want ultra-fast charging and technologies are available but these should be used sparingly as fast charging stresses the battery. If at all possible, do not exceed a charge rate of 1C(See BU-402: What is C-rate?) Avoid full charges that take less than 90 minutes. Ultra-fast charging is ideal for EV drivers on the run and this is fine for occasional use. Some EVs keep a record of stressful battery events and this data could be used to nullify a warranty claim(See BU-401a: Fast and Ultrafast Chargers)\nEstimating SoC has always been a challenge, and the SoC accuracy of a battery is not at the same level as dispensing liquid fuel. EV engineers at an SAE meeting in Detroit were surprised to learn that the SoC on some new BMS were off by 15 percent. This is hidden to the user; spare capacity makes up for a shortfall.\nEV makers must further account for capacity fade in a clever and non-alarming way to the motorist. This is solved by oversizing the battery and only showing the driving range. A new battery is typically charged to 80 percent and discharged to 30 percent. As the battery fades, the bandwidth may expand to keep the same driving range. Once the full capacity range is needed, the entire cycle is applied. This will cause stress to the aging battery and shorten the driving ranges visibly. Figure 5 illustrates three SoH ranges of an EV fuel gauge.\nA new EV battery only charges to about 80% and discharges to 30%. As the battery ages, more of the usable battery bandwidth is demanded, which will result in increased stress and enhanced aging.\nOn the surface, driving on electricity is cheaper than burning fossil fuel; however, low fuel prices, uncertainty about battery longevity, unfamiliarity with battery abuse tolerances and high replacement costs are factors that reduce buyer incentives to switch from a proven propulsion system to the electric drivetrain. The EV will always have shorter driving ranges than vehicles with ICE because oversizing the battery has a diminishing return. When the size is increased, batteries simply get too heavy, negatively affecting travel economics and driving range(See BU-1005: Fuel Cell Vehicle)\nTechnology Roadmaps as part of the International Energy Agency (IEA) compares energy consumption and cost of gasoline versus electric propulsion;\nAn EV requires between 150Wh and 250Wh per kilometer depending on vehicle weight, speed and terrain. At an assumed consumption of 200Wh/km and electricity price of $0.20 per kWh, the energy cost to drive an EV translates to $0.04 per km. This compares to $0.06 per km for a similar-size gasoline-powered car and $0.05 per km for diesel. Price estimations exclude equipment costs, service and the eventual replacement of the product.\nBattery endurance and cost will govern the success of the EV. A consumer market will likely develop for a light EV with a battery providing 160km (100 miles) driving range or less. This will be a subcompact commuter car owned by a driver who adheres to a tightly regimented driving routine and follows a disciplined recharging regime. According to research, 90 percent of commuting involves less than 30km. The EV market will also include high-end models for the ecology-minded wealthy wanting to reduce greenhouse gases.\nDriving an EV only delivers optimal environmental benefit when charging with renewable resources. Burning coal and fossil fuel to generate electricity, as is done in many countries, does not reduce greenhouse gases. In the US, 50 percent of electricity is generated by burning coal, 20 percent by natural gas and 20 percent by nuclear energy. Renewable energy by hydro is 8 percent and solar/wind energy is only 2 percent.\nGoing electric also begs the question, “Who will pay for the roads in the absence of fuel tax?” Governments spend billions on road maintenance and expansions; the EV, and in part the PHEV, can use the infrastructure for free. This is unfair for folks using public transport as they pay double: first paying income tax to support the road infrastructures and second in purchasing the train fare.\nThe high cost of the EV against the lure of cheap and readily available fossil fuel will slow the transition to clean driving. Government subsidies may be needed to make “green” cars affordable to the masses, but many argue that such handouts should be directed towards better public transportation, systems that had been ignored in North America since the 1950s.\n[1] Source: Tesla Motors\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Knowing the health of a battery is important, but no quick method exists to test them with certainty. State-of-health (SoH) cannot be measured per se, only estimated to various degrees of accuracies based on available symptoms. A battery behaves much like a living organism that is swayed by conditions such as state-of-charge (SoC), charge and discharge events, rest periods, environmental conditions and aging. A battery with low charge behaves similarly to a pack that exhibits capacity loss and these two symptoms become a blur. Battery test methods must look beyond mood swings and capture characteristics that only relate to SoH.\nThe leading health indicator of a battery is capacity; a unit that represents the ability to store energy. A new battery delivers (should deliver) 100 percent of the rated Ah capacity. Lead acid starts at about 85 percent and the capacity will increase with use before the long and gradual decrease begins. Lithium-ion enters service at peak capacity and starts its decline with use and aging, albeit very slowly. Nickel-based batteries need priming to reach full capacity and also follow the gradual decline with use.\nTo reduce stress, charge Li-ion with a moderate two to three-hour charge rather than an ultra-fast charge lasting less than one hour. Prevent harsh and erratic dischargers. It is better not to drain a battery fully but charge it more often. As the author of www.BatteryUniversity.com I am citing these recommendations; they are the most commonly asked questions of this popular educational website on batteries.\nDevice manufacturers base the performance specification on a new battery, but this is only a snapshot at the beginning of a career. Like a sports athlete, the performance will drop with time and the loss will only become visible after the shine of a new device has worn off and daily routines are taken for granted. As the runtime shortens, battery-related breakdowns begin to occur more often and the battery becomes a nuisance. An analogy is an aging man whose decreased endurance begins to show after the most productive years draw to an end. Figure 1 demonstrates such an aging process.\nWhen asking battery users: “At what capacity do you replace the battery?” most reply in confusion: “I beg your pardon?” Capacity as a measure of storage capability and runtime is poorly understood. Nor is capacity used as a threshold to retire a battery unless they are serviced with a battery analyzer.\nBattery retirement depends on the application. Healthcare, defense and public safety organizations with battery analyzers set the replacement threshold typically to 80 percent. There are applications where the battery can be kept longer and there is a balance between cost and risk, also known as economics and “what if.” Some scanning devices in warehouses can go as low as 60 percent and still provide a full day’s work. A starter battery in a car still cranks well at 40 percent. Engine-starting requires only a short discharge burst that is replenished while driving, but letting the capacity go much lower than the 40-percent threshold may get the driver stranded without warning.\nA reliable indicator to assure sufficient runtime is checking the spare capacity on return of a mission or a day’s shift. The Cadex battery analyzers do this by applying a discharge before charge. A battery should always have 10–20 percent spare capacity at the end of the shift to cover unknowns and emergencies. If the weakest battery in the fleet returns with 30 percent remaining capacity, then the target may be lowered from, say, 80 to 70 percent. Such fine-tuning maximizes battery life without added risk, resulting is cost savings. Figure 2 illustrates a battery analyzer that provides this service.\nThe importance of checking the battery regularly is illustrated on a battery-powered drone. The drone in our example is specified to fly for 60 minutes with a good battery. Unknown to mission control, the capacity may have dropped from 100 percent to 75 percent, reducing the flying time from 60 to 45 minutes. Not aware of the capacity fade, the shorter runtime could crash a $50,000 vehicle when forced to navigate a second landing approach.\nThe analyzer’s print option makes capacity, internal battery resistance and service dates visible on a label that is attached to each battery. Figure 3 illustrates such a label. With this information available on each pack, batteries delivering close to 100 percent can be assigned for long hauls while older packs would fly shorter errands. Another label method is identifying each battery with a bar code number. Scanning the code fetches historical battery information, configures the analyzer to the correct battery setting and adds the new service information.\nMany batteries and portable devices include fuel gauges. While these show the remaining charge, capacity estimation is not possible. The state-of-charge will always show 100 percent after a full charge whether the battery is new or faded. This creates a false sense of security by assuming that a fully charged battery will faithfully deliver the anticipated runtime.\nNot only does the battery capacity drop with use and time, the fuel gauge also loses accuracy and the battery needs calibration. The instruction manual of an Apple iPad says: “For proper reporting of SoC, be sure to go through at least one full charge/discharge cycle per month.” Engineers call this “digital memory.”\nThe industry is aware of deficiencies and since the mid-1990s has added “smarts” to mission-critical batteries. The SMBus is a widely used format that measures voltage and current during charge and discharge. While this provides valuable battery information such as SoC, cycle count and error diagnostics, true capacity estimation is not possible. The digital battery, which the SMBus manages, is exclusively based on the peripherals of the chemical battery, information that is assumed and drifts with time. Calibration is done by a full discharge/charge cycle in the device or with a battery analyzer.\nIn the absence of regular battery maintenance, some device manufacturers mandate battery replacement according to a date-stamping or cycle count. A pack may fail before the appointed time has expired but most last far longer, prompting perfectly good batteries to be discarded prematurely. Dr. Imre Gyuk, manager of the Energy Storage Research Program at DOE, says that “every year roughly one million usable lithium-ion batteries are sent in for recycling with most having a capacity of up to 80 percent.”\nBattery problems also affect healthcare. An FDA survey says that “up to 50% of service calls in hospitals surveyed relate to battery issues.” Healthcare professionals at the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instruments (AAMI) say that “battery management emerged as a top 10 medical device challenge.”\nWhen Rubber-stamping is not enoughSimply choosing the best battery from the lot to get a device rubber-stamped by the approval agencies is not enough. Equally or more important is assuring that the device provides continued performance to the planned retirement. While the approval process can be overly detailed and painstakingly slow, few rules apply to assure continued reliability once approved and released,. The agencies have done their job; they wash their hands and pass the responsibility on to the user.\nRubber-stamping appears simpler than enforcing standards to ensure continued field reliability. Device manufacturers are an easy target and authorities can shut them down for trivial infractions. Placing too much importance on the “cradle-to-graduation” can overshadow the vital phase of “deployment-to-retirement.” It is the battery that gets exhausted first and needs replacement. A host device may see several batteries during its service life and the health-check procedure must be made more effective.\nSmall to mid-sized batteries should be checked with a full discharge/charge cycle on a battery analyzer. This measures the battery capacity and calibrates the smart circuit. Rapid-testing would be desirable but the developments are not sufficiently mature for all applications, nor does rapid-testing calibrate the battery. However, it is better to rapid-test with a less reliable method than to disregard the test altogether.\nLarger battery systems that cannot be removed from service or are impractical to cycle are equipped with a battery management system (BMS). Research is continuing to include capacity estimation by applying electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This technology is being developed to rapid-test a broad range of batteries, including starter batteries on vehicles.\nSummary It appears as if little has changed since the invention of the lead acid battery by Gaston Planté in 1859. We don’t even have a reliable method to measure state-of-charge; not to mention attaining accurate capacity assessments as part of rapid-testing. Simply measuring voltage and internal resistance, as was done in the past, is no longer sufficient to estimate state-of-charge and capacity. Batteries have improved and keep low resistance throughout life. The research team of Cadex is working on several developments that will make battery performance more transparent and accountable to the user.\nAbout the AuthorIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "content": "All products have a Remaining Useful Life (RUL), governed by State-of-Health (SoH). This also applies to batteries, and better SoH assessment will improve RUL estimations. Batteries seldom fail unexpectedly; most reach end-of-life following the SoH trail. Capacity is the leading health indicator that fades linearly and predictably. Anomalies do occur; many are mechanical in nature caused by aggressive use that may lead to increased internal resistance (Ri) or electrical short. Dendrites in Li-ion are an example.\nEstablishing RUL requires a Minimum Viable Performance (MVP) by establishing the lowest acceptable function level below which the battery is no longer viable for a given application. End-of-life for most batteries is a capacity of 80%. Instead of a 10-hour service, as possible with 100% capacity, 80% will only give 8 hours of run time.\nThe starter battery in a vehicle provides more tolerance and cranking is still possible at a capacity of 30%, or lower. Passing a capacity test reading above 40% promises one year grace, good to the next service. Figure 1 demonstrates the capacity drop of a starter battery with end-of-life point at 30%.\nMore accurate RUL estimations are possible by tracking the SoH of a battery with cloud analytics. This is made possible by storing performance data received from diagnostic chargers, analyzers, monitors and rapid-testers over time.\nIndustries benefiting from cloud analytics are health care, public safety, defense, logistics, drones and robotic operators by tracing the capacity loss over time and estimating the time dropping to the red line denoting end-of-life. The red line denoting MVP is set by the intrinsic Target Selector.\nA battery should have 20% remaining charge at the end of a day. If consistently low, the Target Selector should be set higher to secure enough capacity for unexpected events. However, with ample SoC, the threshold can be lowered to keep batteries in service longer. Observing the residual charge resembles an airline pilot carrying enough fuel to enable a secure landing with headwind.\nBattery testing and diagnostic evaluations vary according to battery system and application. To estimate RUL, capacity readings must be tracked over time, and this is a challenge with larger systems. Most Battery Management Systems (BMS) measure voltage, Ri and temperature. These parameters alone are unable to provide a capacity reading; however, with historic data and known MVP, URL can be predicted over time. Most common battery test methods are:\nModern chargers include diagnostic features that assess the capacity by reading the FCC of a SMBus battery. Regular batteries use the parser technology by establishing the residual state-of-charge (SoC) with intelligent filtering and then measuring the coulombs required to fully charge the pack. SoC plus charge equals the usable capacity. The parser needs a long “runway” to measure the capacity; a topping charge alone cannot give a reliable reading.\nDiagnostic chargers are hybrid devices that service smart and dumb batteries side-by-side. A SoH light verifies that the capacity is met, adjustable by the intrinsic target selector. The SoH light only illuminates if diagnostic data is available. SoH analytics in modern diagnostic chargers run in the background.\nCloud connectivity paves the way to Reliability Assurance Maintenance Systems (RAMS) in making battery fleets transparent to users and fleet supervisors alike. Battery diagnostics has been lagging behind other services, such as RCM\n(Reliability-centered Maintenance) that predicts mechanical wear-and-tear. Batteries can no longer be installed and forgotten. Knowing the URL enables scheduled replacement before a failure occurs. Modern diagnostic systems are available to grant risk management in batteries.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "In closing, the author stresses the importance of observing battery performance. The battery begins to fade the moment it comes off the assembly line; it is also one of the most prone parts to fail. While a faded pack in a personal device may only cause mild inconvenience, loss of mission-critical power can have serious consequences.\nSafety falls under regulatory authorities and being labeled uncontrollable, the battery tends to evade the scrutiny of inspection. This allows weak batteries to hide in a system and cause havoc. Meanwhile seemingly less important regulatory issues are being tightened to the hilts with only moderate benefit. The battery is a scapegoat.\nBatteries should receive the same treatment as a critical part in an aircraft or machine where wear-and-tear falls under strict maintenance guidelines. This is not the case with batteries.\nJet engine life is measured in flight-hours and flight cycles. One cycle is a take-off and landing. An Airbus 330 needs maintenance after 200-400 cycles.\nA biomed technician said: “Batteries are the most abused components. Staff care little about them and only do the bare minimum. References to battery maintenance are vague and hidden inside service manuals.”\nA new device is approved with a perfect battery, rendering the procedure flawed. Batteries will fade in use and field personnel ask, “At what capacity should I replace the battery? How much spare is enough? How often should I test the pack?”\nAn AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation) survey of medical professionals states: “Battery management emerged as a top 10 medical device challenge.” A US FDA survey says, “up to 50 percent of issues in hospitals are battery related.” (FDA regulations are very tough in other fields.)\nA Li-ion battery in a medical device lasts for about 5 years. In the absence of battery maintenance, the manufacturers mandate a 2-year life span. Most packs still have over 90 percent capacity when being discarded. DOE reports that “every year roughly one million usable Li-ion batteries are sent in for recycling with most having a capacity of up to 80 percent.”\nBattery developments fall into two categories: Birth-to-graduation and workforce-to-retirement. Striving for higher capacities is desirable but battery fade must also be observed. Capacity is the leading health indicator, a measure that is poorly understood. When battery users are asked, “At what capacity do you replace the battery?” most reply in confusion, “I beg your pardon?”\nBattery maintenance has a good return rate, but when demonstrating a battery analyzer, the manager of a US railway company quipped, “Our guys could not be bothered testing batteries; they throw them out with the radios.” (The company maintained 10,000 high-end radios.)\nBattery diagnostics and monitoring have lagged behind other technologies but an industrial revolution in batteries is looming. In the 1970s, the world had computers but little software. Bill Gates changed this around. Today, the world evolves around batteries but lacks control technology. Modern systems will assess battery performance while charging and make the results transparent to the battery user and fleet manager alike.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Advanced Battery Analyzers",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/advanced-battery-analyzers",
        "content": "How are batteries checked and serviced? This article describes the advancements of the modern battery analyzer and explains how these instruments are used in the industry. While organizations such as public safety have been using battery analyzers for the last two decades to restore and prolong nickel-cadmium batteries, analyzers have made their way also into the cell phone, portable computing, medical and defense markets. The early models were impractical and did not adapt well to changing battery chemistries. In addition, the analyzers provided limited service and did not offer the quick test results and restoration capabilities customers demand today.The last few years have brought a rebirth of the battery analyzer. With the move from the high-maintenance nickel-based batteries to the maintenance-free lithium-based packs, the duty of a battery analyzer is changing from life-extending cycling to rapid testing and boosting.\nThere are two basic types of battery analyzers: the fixed current and programmable versions. Fixed current units are the lower priced of the two, and charge and discharge a battery at a preset current of about 600mA. Smaller batteries get serviced reasonably fast but larger batteries are slow. The service time of an 1800mAh battery is three times that of a 600mAh pack. The capacity readout is in mAh and reflects the length of discharge. The fixed-current analyzers are the predecessors of the programmable units.\nThe programmable analyzers allow servicing the battery against preset parameters. The charge and discharge currents are adjusted according to the battery rating, and the voltage is set to flag batteries with incorrect voltages. These analyzers provide more accurate readings and enable higher battery throughput than fixed current units. In addition, programmable analyzers are better suited to service new battery systems and have proven to be more effective in restoring weak batteries. The Cadex C7000-Series are such programmable battery analyzers.\nInterfacing the batteries has always been a challenge with battery analyzers. Technicians have invented contraptions with springs and levers so complicated that only they themselves are able to operate. Everybody else stays away from them of fear.Cadex solved the battery interface issue with the custom adapters for common batteries and the universal adapters for specialty packs. The custom adapters are the easiest to use and provide the most accurate test results. User-programmable cables accommodate larger batteries or assist when no adapter is on hand. Smaller batteries can be serviced with the Cadex FlexArm™. Two contact probes mounted on flexible arms provide the connection when lowered to the battery terminals. Magnetic guides keep the battery in position and a temperature sensor safeguards the battery. Figure 1 illustrates the Cadex FlexArm™.\nThe Cadex adapters contain a memory chip that configures the analyzer to the correct setting. Each adapter stores 10 battery configuration codes to service 10 different battery types. The parameters can be edited with a few keystrokes on the analyzer's keypad.\nAdvanced battery analyzers are capable of evaluating battery conditions and implementing corrective service to restore weak performance. The Cadex system, for example, automatically applies a recondition cycle to nickel-based packs if a user-selected target capacity cannot be reached. Other programs include Prime to prepare a new battery for field use, Charge to allow fast-charge and Custom to apply unique cycles composed of charge, discharge, recondition, trickle charge or any combination, including rest periods and repeats.Many modern analyzers also offer battery rapid test programs. This often requires entering the battery voltage and rating (in mAh). To obtain accurate readings, a battery-specific matrix may also be required. The Cadex QuickTest™ stores the matrix in the battery adapter, together with the configuration code. Installing the adapter sets the analyzer to the correct parameters, transparent to the user. With the Cadex system, the matrix is commonly included when purchasing the adapter. If missing, scanning several batteries with various state-of-health conditions creates the matrix. The test time is 3 minutes and requires a charge level of 20-90%. If outside this range, the analyzer automatically applies a brief charge or discharge. Many batteries are discarded, even when restoration is possible. Cell phone dealers have confirmed that 80-90% of returned mobile phone batteries can be repaired with a battery analyzer. However, most dealers are not equipped to handle the influx of warranty batteries and the packs are returned to the manufacturers for replacement or are discarded. Rapid test enables checking the battery while the customer waits. Minor battery problems can be corrected on the spot.A typical failure of lithium-ion batteries is excessive low discharge. If discharged below 2.5 volts per cell, the internal safety circuit deactivates and the battery no longer accepts charge with a regular charger. An excessive low discharge can occur if the battery is not recharged for some time after a full discharge through extensive use. The Cadex battery analyzers feature Boost, a program, which reactivates batteries that appear dead. Boost works by applying a gentle current to the battery to re-energize the safety circuit and raise the cell voltage. After reaching the operating voltage, the battery can be charged and tested normally. Boosted batteries perform flawlessly as long as a repeat deep discharge is avoided.\nMost analyzers are capable of printing service reports and battery labels. This feature simplifies maintenance, especially in a fleet environment where the operators must observe periodic service requirements. Printed reports also benefit customer service staff and engineers.\nLabeling the batteries with service date and test results is self-governing in the sense that the user only picks a properly labeled battery and has recently been serviced. Batteries with past due service date are segregated for service. With such a system, the user has full confidence that the battery will last through the shift, with energy to spare.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-803c-loss-of-electrolyte",
        "content": "The loss of electrolyte in a flooded lead acid battery occurs through gassing as hydrogen escapes during charging and discharging. Venting causes the electrolyte to become more concentrated, and the balance must be restored by adding clean water. Do not add electrolyte as this upsets the specific gravity and shortens battery life by promoting corrosion.\nLoss of electrolyte in sealed lead acid batteries is a recurring problem that is often caused by overcharging. Careful adjustment of charging and float voltages, as well as operating at moderate temperatures, reduces this failure. In flooded batteries, lost water can be replenished by refilling, but in sealed batteries water loss can lead to dry-out and decline of performance. Replenishing lost liquid in VRLA batteries by adding water has been tried with limited success. Although the lost capacity can often be regained with a catalyst, tampering with the cells turns the stack into a high-maintenance project that needs constant supervision.\nNickel-based batteries can lose electrolyte through repeated venting due to excessive pressure during extreme charge or discharge, as well as from overcharge. Inaccurate full-charge detection and elevated trickle charge can lead to overcharge. This is especially true with aging and faded packs. After recurring venting, the spring-loaded seal of the cells may not seal properly again and the deposit of white powder around the seal opening is evidence of leakage. Sloppy manufacturing can also lead to electrolyte loss. Dry-up conditions result in a “soft” cell, a defect that cannot be corrected. On charge, the voltage of a “dry” cell goes high because the battery has no clamping ability. It is no longer chemically active and does not draw current.\nA properly designed and correctly charged lithium-ion cell should not generate gases, nor should it lose electrolyte through venting. In spite of what advocates say, lithium-based cells can build up an internal pressure under certain conditions, and a bloated pouch cell is proof of this(See BU-301a: Types of Battery Cells) Some cells include an electrical switch that opens if the cell pressure reaches a critical level. Others feature a membrane that releases gases. Many of these safety features are one way only, meaning that once activated, the cell becomes inoperable. This is done for safety reasons(See BU-304a: Safety Concerns with Li-ion)\nWhen overcharged, a battery gases, splitting water in the electrolyte into hydrogen and oxygen. A battery becomes a “water-splitting device” by electrolysis. A parallel is the fuel cell but it does the opposite way, turning oxygen and hydrogen into electricity by producing water. Energy is needed to produce oxygen and hydrogen and the battery gets the energy through overcharging.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-802a-how-does-rising-internal-resistance-affect-performance",
        "content": "Capacity alone is of limited use if the pack cannot deliver the stored energy effectively; a battery also needs low internal resistance. Measured in milliohms (mΩ), resistance is the gatekeeper of the battery; the lower the resistance, the less restriction the pack encounters. This is especially important in heavy loads such as power tools and electric powertrains. High resistance causes the battery to heat up and the voltage to drop under load, triggering an early shutdown. Figure 1 illustrates a battery with low internal resistance in the form of a free-flowing tap against a battery with elevated resistance in which the tap is restricted.\nFigure 1: Effects of internal battery resistance.\nA battery with low internal resistance delivers high current on demand. High resistance causes the battery to heat up and the voltage to drop. The equipment cuts off, leaving energy behind.\nLead acid has a very low internal resistance and the battery responds well to high current bursts that last for a few seconds. Due to inherent sluggishness, however, lead acid does not perform well on a sustained high current discharge; the battery soon gets tired and needs a rest to recover. Some sluggishness is apparent in all batteries at different degrees but it is especially pronounced with lead acid. This hints that power delivery is not based on internal resistance alone but also on the responsiveness of the chemistry, as well as temperature. In this respect, nickel- and lithium-based technologies are more responsive than lead acid.\nSulfation and grid corrosion are the main contributors to the rise of the internal resistance with lead acid. Temperature also affects the resistance; heat lowers it and cold raises it. Heating the battery will momentarily lower the internal resistance to provide extra runtime. This, however, does not restore the battery and will add momentary stress.\nCrystalline formation, also known as “memory,” contributes to the internal resistance in nickel-based batteries. This can often be reversed with deep-cycling. The internal resistance of Li-ion also increases with use and aging but improvements have been made with electrolyte additives to keep the buildup of films on the electrodes under control. ( See BU-808b: What causes Li-ion to Die? ) With all batteries, SoC affects the internal resistance. Li-ion has higher resistance at full charge and at end of discharge with a big flat low resistance area in the middle.\nAlkaline, carbon-zinc and most primary batteries have a relatively high internal resistance, and this limits their use to low-current applications such as flashlights, remote controls, portable entertainment devices and kitchen clocks. As these batteries deplete, the resistance increases further. This explains the relative short runtime when using ordinary alkaline cells in digital cameras.\nTwo methods are used to read the internal resistance of a battery: Direct current (DC) by measuring the voltage drop at a given current, and alternating current (AC), which takes reactance into account. When measuring a reactive device such as a battery, the resistance values vary greatly between the DC and AC test methods, but neither reading is right or wrong. The DC reading looks at pure resistance (R) and provides true results for a DC load such as a heating element. The AC reading includes reactive components and provides impedance (Z). Impedance provides realistic results on a digital load such as a mobile phone or an inductive motor. ( See BU-902: How to Measure Internal Resistance )\nFigure 2 illustrates the internal resistance of an 18650 Li-ion cell when exposed to 1,000 full cycles at 40ºC (104ºF). The AC readings in the green frame do not reflect the true resistive state of a battery; DC method provides more reliable performance data with loading.\nThe internal resistance of a battery does not consist of the cells alone but also includes the interconnection, fuses, protection circuits and wiring. In most cases these peripherals more than double the internal resistance and can falsify rapid-test methods. Typical readings of a single cell pack for a mobile phone and a multi-cell battery for a power tool are shown below.\nFigures 3, 4 and 5 reflect the runtime of three batteries with similar Ah and capacities but different internal resistance when discharged at 1C, 2C and 3C. The graphs demonstrate the importance of maintaining low internal resistance, especially at higher discharge currents. The NiCd test battery comes in at 155mΩ, NiMH has 778mΩ and Li-ion has 320mΩ. These are typical resistive readings on aged but still functional batteries. (See BU-208: Cycling Performance) that demonstrates the relationship of capacity, internal resistance and self-discharge.)\nNotes: The tests were done when early mobile phones were powered by NiCd, NiMH and Li-ion. Li-ion and NiMH have since improved.\nThe maximum GSM draws is 2.5A, representing 3C from an 800mAh pack, or three times the rated current.\n[1] Source: Technische Universität München (TUM)[2] Source: Siemens AG (2015, München)[3] Courtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "How to Make Batteries in Medical Devices More Reliable",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/how-to-make-batteries-in-medical-devices-more-reliable",
        "content": "Batteries are critical components in medical devices. As more instruments are computerized and become mobile, systems performance and reliability depends heavily on the battery. Improvements in battery reliability are necessary, and at a recent workshop with Cadex Electronics, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Silver Spring, MD, expressed these concerns about batteries in medical devices:\nThe purpose of the workshop was to find solutions by exploring new techniques in battery diagnostics and monitoring. The FDA is scheduling additional meetings with health care professionals and device manufacturers to which Cadex will again play a supportive role. Brainstorming with specialty groups will explore battery aging and how to assess and manage this phenomenon.\nA battery is a corrosive device that begins fading the moment it leaves the factory. Its stubborn and unpredictable behaviour has left many users in awkward situations. According to reports, up to 50% of system breakdowns are attributed to a battery. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) has identified batteries as one of the top 10 challenges facing biomedical departments in a hospital setting. Some of this can be avoided, but even with the best of care, some packs die early and scientists don’t know why. Batteries exhibit human-like characteristics andtheir state-of-health rests on genetic makeup, environmental conditions and user patterns.\nThe manufacturer specifies the runtime of a device with a battery performing at 100%, a capacity that only exists for a short time; most batteries in use operate at less. With time, the performance declines and the battery gets smaller in terms of energy storage. Most batteries deliver 300 to 500 discharge/ charge cycles; less on full discharges in a harsh environment.\nMost batteries work well in the first year, but the confidence begins to fade in the second and third year. New packs are added and in time the battery fleet becomes a jumble of good and failing batteries. That’s when the headache begins. Unless batteries are examined regularly as part of quality assurance, the user has little knowledge on the performance of each pack.\nThe energy in a battery can be divided into three segments: available energy, the empty zone that can be refilled, and the unusable part, or rock content, that has become dormant and is growing. Figure 1 illustrates these three sections graphically.\nFigure 1: The three segments of a battery\nA battery stays at full performance for a limited time only. Device manufacturers must assure reliable operation with a battery that is less than 100 percent.\nThe “ready” light on a charger cannot verify battery state-of-health; it only indicates that the battery is fully charged. As the active space of a battery declines with use, the charge time also decreases. This can be compared to topping a water jug that has been filled with rocks. The shorter charge time pushes weak batteries to the forefront by being ready; they become a hidden disguise for the unsuspecting users placing much faith in the green light.\nLet’s now address the concerns of the FDA and examine viable remedies.\nTo meet the strict approval process, manufacturers pick the best battery from the pool. This satisfies the present moment but ignores tolerances in battery performances and capacity losses that develop over time. As part of routine quality check, the manufacturers may check only the voltage and internal resistance of a cell or battery; capacity, the leading health indicator is omitted, and for good reasons. Capacity assessment is complex and a measurement by a discharge/charge cycle is time prohibitive.\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) offers promising solutions in estimating capacity and detecting anomalies. This is of special interest to battery manufactures and a close collaboration will be necessary to examine what battery faults EIS can identify. Cadex went further and developed multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Spectro™). Spectro ™ is able to read battery capacity non-invasively. Matrices will need to be developed for each battery type to check each cell or battery against the “golden sample.” The 15 to 30-second test makes this possible.\nThe FDA is a sounding board for battery failures and has noted that some implant batteries provide less than half the estimated runtime, hinting to manufacturing deficiencies. A low battery may manifest itself as fatigue in the patient. Doctors are trained to diagnose medical symptoms and are less familiar with the effect of a faded battery. There is also a case where an implant battery shorted and burned the tissues of the patient. As we depend more and more on batteries for our well-being, quality control using advanced technologies will eventually reduce risk and lower medical costs.\nRegulatory institutions are concerned that device manufacturers do not place sufficient importance on battery aging. No uniform consumption model exists in assessing capacity; some medical devices are in constant use, others are on standby, skewing aging estimations. Environmental conditions further add to complexity. Safety during the battery life is a further concern that needs attention.\nBatteries perform best at room temperature and live longest when stressed only moderately. “Smart” batteries offer a benefit by displaying the remaining charge, but fuel gauge readings can be off. To maintain accuracy, a smart battery needs regular calibration to correct the tracking error between the chemical and digital battery. A calibration should be done every three months or after 40 partial cycles. If the device applies a periodic deep discharge on its own accord, no additional calibration is required.\nEven though sealed, some cells include vents to release gases that develop during use or exposure to stressful conditions. The electric toothbrush was brought up as an example where venting was ignored. The engineers specified a waterproof device, not knowing that an alkaline battery produces some gases during discharge. The accumulated gases inside a toothbrush led to an explosion that injured the user.\nThe modification of the Boeing B787 Dreamliner battery is another example where battery behavior was overlooked. The engineers estimated smoke events on the Li-ion battery to occur only once in 10 million flight hours, but two packs failed on new aircrafts in less than 100,000 flight hours. The mandated battery modification involves isolating individual cells to avert a chain reaction should one overheat, placing the battery in a steel container capable of withstanding a fire without damaging the surrounding areas, and adding a one-way vent to release gases from a burning battery to the outside. Designers of medical devices can learn from this experience.\nA battery is a consumable component that gradually loses performance over time. Unlike a car tire that can be inspected for wear and tear and replaced when the treads are low, the battery is a black box that does not change color, size or weight; it quits on its own time table. Device manufacturers must make the users aware of the symptoms of a weak battery and hint to battery replacement policies. This is not well understood in the medical industry and needs attention. When the author of this article asks users, “At what capacity do you replace the battery,” most shrug their shoulders and say, “I don’t know.”\nBesides assuring sufficient energy reserve, medical device users must also plan for a worst-case scenario. Although manufacturers do include some reserve, it became apparent at the FDA meeting that this is not clearly defined. Energy reserve as part of battery aging and worst-case scenario varies by application. Critical missions need tighter requirements and such a battery might need replacement sooner than for less demanding uses where an unexpected failure can be tolerated. Figure 2 provides tolerances for fade and spare, bringing the usable battery capacity to 60% in worst-case scenario.\nFigure 2: Calculating spare battery capacity\nReserve capacity must be calculated for worst-case scenario. The allowable capacity range is 80-100%; a spare capacity of 20% is recommended for critical use.\nSome public safety organisations use the highest performing batteries for critical applications and pass packs with shrinking capacities to less demanding roles where replacements are on hand should a failure occur. Placing batteries into different tier levels allows economical use of batteries without sacrificing reliability. Performance evaluation based on capacity can only be done reliably with battery maintenance. Neither date-stamping nor the use of a smart battery provides reliable alternatives. (Cadex Electronics specializes in battery analyzers and management systems.)\nBattery diagnostics has not advanced as quickly as other technologies, but progress is being made. Experts predict that EIS will lead the path and the results at the Cadex laboratories are promising. A growing number of hospitals and paramedics are also taking the proactive approach towards battery maintenance. Servicing a large battery fleet on automated battery analyzers takes less than one hour a day and the payback is estimated at one year on battery savings alone. Increased risk management and reducing the environmental impact of discarding batteries too early are added bonuses. Utilizing new technologies in battery management will make a noticeable change in the reliability of medical devices.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "The saying goes: “So you can start the car, but will the battery crank the engine again tomorrow?” With rapid electrification in vehicles, concerns also arise with steering and breaking drawing draw 100 amperes from the battery.\nThe battery is the most failure-prone part in a system. Most battery testers and the Battery Management Systems (BMS) read the open battery circuit voltage and calculated the internal resistance (Ri) on voltage-drop under load. This method will find battery anomalies but cannot assess capacity, the leading health indicator.\nCapacity of a battery declines unnoticed until cranking fails. To provide predictive maintenance in the absence of capacity assessment, some BMS advise the driver to replace the battery on a fixed number of starts.\nA new technology is gaining acceptance that assesses battery capacity by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The technology is non-invasive and is available in commercial products known as Spectro™. Figure 1 illustrates the compact Spectro Modular.\nEIS applies a sinusoidal signal from 2,000Hz to 100mHz to create a Nyquist plot. Modelling refers to matrices that had been derived from same-type batteries but different performance levels. Data fusion correlates the values to derive capacity, CCA, SoC and other battery readings. Figure 2 illustrates complex modeling a simplified flowchart.\nCapacity governing end of battery life is demonstrated again and again. ADAC, a German Auto Club, reports that 46% of car breakdown are caused by the battery, up from 42% in 2010. A study by Johnson Control (JCI) involving 800 AGM starter batteries revealed that 48% of batteries became unusable due to low capacity while only 12% failed by low CCA. Failure by poor cranking gives a warning, capacity fade goes unnoticed. Capacity assessment is valuable as the correlation between capacity and CCA is 55% on average.\nThe JCI test pool in Figure 3 also shows 23% in low charge. This is often caused by city driving with auxiliaries engaged. A shorted cell may also be the reason lowering the battery voltage when fully charged. This is a common in large trucks because of vibration.\nBatteries are often replaced for no apparent reason, and this amounts to 15% in this JCI test. This misjudgment can be resolved with better testing technologies.\nThe capacity of a starter battery may drop below 30% and still crank the engine. The pass/fail threshold of most Spectro™ battery testers is set to 40%. This gives a grace period on pass to next service; however, fail calls for a replacement even if cranking is still strong. Capacity determines the end-of-life.\nTest time is 30 seconds; longer for large batteries because of an extended frequency range. Spectro™ battery testers can be configured for most batteries, including lithium based systems. Starter batteries use a generic matrix with pass/fail classification; model-specific batteries require a designated matrix. The dexterity of designated matrix hinges on the Matrix Integrity Level (MIL) which can be developed to provide numeric readings. Figure 4 demonstrates predictive capacity fade with a 40% pass/fail threshold.\nThe CCA on a starter battery tends to stay solid while the capacity gradually decreases. Figure 5 illustrates 20 aging starter batteries that deliver acceptable CCA performance while the capacity on half the test pool dropped below working level.\nA German luxury car manufacturer studied capacity and CCA fade of 175 AGM batteries. Figure 6 shows a trend by the arrow that is passing through the Capacity End-of-life gate set at 40%.\nA capacity threshold of 40% works well for consumer auto; truck and bus batteries may require a reserve capacity of 50% and higher to accommodate hotel loads. Reading capacity by EIS brings us closer to predicting the remaining useful life that includes large batteries with capacity up to 300Ah.\nModern battery test devices enable storing test results in a cloud database to enable analytics. The Spectro Modular shown in Figure 7 displays test results on a computing device that also connects to the cloud.\nAdvanced battery test systems include lithium based batteries of up to 48V. These need dedicated matrices to perform quality assurance in manufacturing and check incoming batteries in supply chain. Test accuracies rest on MIL that can be improved on continuous bases.\nEIS opens a non-invasive way to test batteries. Battery characterization using EIS has been in use for decades to study aging effects of batteries but the interpretation was manual. Multi-model EIS automates state-of-health (SoH) assessment. Scientists predict that battery diagnostics is gravitating to EIS, a technology that has not yet explored its potential fully.\nCadex was first-to-market testing batteries with EIS under Spectro™. Being non-invasive and small in footprint will enable including this technology into BMS to assess battery capacity in real life.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808c-coulombic-and-energy-efficiency-with-the-battery",
        "content": "All batteries have losses. The energy retrieved after a charge is always less than what had been put in. Parasitic reaction that occurs within the electrochemistry of the cell prevents the efficiency from reaching 100 percent. Ultra-fast charging and heavy loading also reduces the energy efficiency. This also contributes to battery strain by reducing cycle life.\nBattery efficiency is gaining interest. This is especially critical with large battery systems in electric vehicles, energy storage systems (ESS) and satellites. The efficiency factor is commonly measured by coulombic efficiency. A coulomb is a unit of electric charge. One coulomb equals one ampere-second (1As).\nCoulombic efficiency (CE), also called faradaic efficiency or current efficiency, describes the charge efficiency by which electrons are transferred in batteries. CE is the ratio of the total charge extracted from the battery to the total charge put into the battery over a full cycle.\nLi-ion has one of the highest CE ratings in rechargeable batteries. It offers an efficiency that exceeds 99 percent. This, however, is only possible when charged at a moderate current and at cool temperatures. Ultra-fast charging lowers the CE because of losses due to charge acceptance and heat, so also does a very slow charge in which self-discharge comes into play(See BU-808b: What Causes Li-ion to Die)\nThe coulombic efficiency of Li-ion improves with cycling. To prove this, Panasonic, E-one Moli, Sony, LG and Samsung Li-ion batteries in 18650 cell format where cycled. Some cells began with a coulombic efficiency of 99.1 percent and improved to 99.5 percent with 15 cycles. Some started at 99.5 percent and reached 99.9 percent with 30 cycles. The consistency on repeat tests was high, reflecting in Li-ion being a very stable battery system.\nLead acid comes in lower at a CE of about 90 percent, and nickel-based batteries are generally lower yet. With fast charge, NiCd and NiMH may reach 90 percent but a slow charge reduces this to about 70 percent. Lower charge acceptance when above 70 percent state-of-charge and self-discharge that increases when the battery gets warm toward the end of charge are contributing factors for the low CE. Best efficiencies of all batteries are attained in mid-range state-of-charge of 30 to 70 percent. All battery systems provide unique CE values that vary with charge rates and temperature. Age also plays a role.\nVoltaic efficiency is another way to measure battery efficiency, which represents the ratio of the average discharge voltage to the average charge voltage. Losses occur because the charging voltage is always higher than the rated voltage to activate the chemical reaction within the battery.\nWhile the coulombic efficiency of lithium-ion is normally better than 99 percent, the energy efficiency of the same battery has a lower number and relates to the charge and discharge C-rate. With a 20-hour charge rate of 0.05C, the energy efficiency is a high 99 percent. This drops to about 97 percent at 0.5C and decreases further at 1C. In the real world, the Tesla Roadster is said to have an energy efficiency of 86 percent. Ultra-fast charging on newer EVs will have a negative effect on energy efficiency, as well as the battery life.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-301-a-look-at-old-and-new-battery-packaging",
        "content": "Early batteries of the 1700s and 1800s developed in Europe were mostly encased in glass jars. As batteries grew in size, jars shifted to sealed wooden containers and composite materials. In the 1890s, battery manufacturing spread from Europe to the United States and in 1896 the National Carbon Company successfully produced a standard cell for widespread consumer use. It was the zinc-carbon Columbia Dry Cell Battery producing 1.5 volts and measuring 6 inches in length.\nWith the move to portability, sealed cylindrical cells emerged that led to standards sizes. The International Electrochemical Commission (IEC), a non-governmental standards organization founded in 1906, developed standards for most rechargeable batteries. In around 1917, the National Institute of Standards and Technology formalized the alphabet nomenclature that is still used today. Table 1 summarizes these historic and current battery sizes.\n* The 21700 cell is also known as 2170. IEC norm calls for the second zero at the end to denote cylindrical format.\nStandardization included primary cells, mostly in zinc-carbon; alkaline emerged only in the early 1960s. With the growing popularity of the sealed nickel-cadmium in the 1950s and 1960s, new sizes appeared, many of which were derived from the “A” and “C” sizes. Beginning in the 1990s, makers of Li-ion departed from conventional sizes and invented their own standards.\nA successful standard is the 18650 cylindrical cell. Developed in the early 1990s for lithium-ion, these cells are used in laptops, electric bicycles and even electric vehicles (Tesla). The first two digits of 18650 designate the diameter in millimeters; the next three digits are the length in tenths of millimeters. The 18650 cell is 18mm in diameter and 65.0mm in length.\nOther sizes are identified with a similar numbering scheme. For example, a prismatic cell carries the number 564656P. It is 5.6mm thick, 46mm wide and 56mm long. P stands for prismatic. Because of the large variety of chemistries and their diversity within, battery cells do not show the chemistry.\nFew popular new standards have immerged since the 18650 appeared in ca. 1991. Several battery manufacturers started experimenting using slightly larger diameters with sizes of 20x70mm, 21x70mm and 22x70mm. Panasonic and Tesla decided on the 21x70, so has Samsung, and other manufacturers followed. The “2170” is only slightly larger than the 18650 it but has 35% more energy (by volume). This new cell is used in the Tesla Model 3 while Samsung is looking at new applications in laptops, power tools, e-bikes and more. It is said that the best diameters in terms of manufacturability is between 18mm and 26mm and the 2170 sits in between. (The 2170 is also known as the 21700.) The 26650 introduced earlier never became a best-seller.\nThe 32650 is primarily available in LiFePO4 (Lithium Iron Phosphate) with a nominal voltage of 3.2V/cell and a typical capacity of 5,000mAh. The dimensions are 32x65mm; true sizes may be slightly larger to allow for insulation and labels.\nOn the prismatic and pouch cell front, new cells are being developed for the electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage systems (ESS). Some of these formats may one day also become readily available similar to the 18650, made in high energy and high power versions, sourced by several manufacturers and sold at a competitive prices. Prismatic and pouch cells currently carry a higher price tag per Wh than the 18650.\nThe EV and ESS markets advance with two distinct philosophies: The use of a large number of small cells produced by an automated process as low cost, as done by Tesla, versus larger cells in the prismatic and pouch formats at a higher price per Wh for now, as done by other EV manufacturers. We have not seen clear winners of either format; time will tell.\nLooking at the batteries in mobile phones and laptops, one sees a departure from established standards. This is due in part to the manufacturers’ inability to agree on a standard, meaning that most consumer devices come with custom-made cells or battery packs. Compact design and market demand are swaying manufacturers to go their own way. High volume with planned obsolescence allows the production of unique sizes in consumer products.\nIn the early days, a battery was perceived “big” by nature, and this is reflected in the sizing convention. While the “F” nomenclature may have been seen as mid-sized in the late 1800s, our forefathers did not anticipate that a battery resembling a credit card could power computers, phones and cameras. Running out of letters towards the smaller sizes led to the awkward numbering of AA, AAA and AAAA.\nSince the introduction of the 9V battery in 1956, no new formats have emerged. Meanwhile portable devices lowered the operating voltages to between 3V and 5V. Switching six cells (6S) in series to attain 9V is expensive to manufacture, and a 3.6V alternative would serve better. This imaginary new pack would have a coding system to prevent charging primaries and select the correct charge algorithm for secondary chemistries.\nStarter batteries for vehicles also follow battery norms that are based on the North American BCI, the European DIN and the Japanese JIS standards. These batteries are similar in footprint to allow swapping. Deep-cycle and stationary batteries follow no standardized norms and the replacement packs must be sourced from the original maker. The attempt to standardize electric vehicle batteries may not work and might follow the failed attempt to standardize laptop batteries in the 1990s.\nStandardization for Li-ion cell formats is diverse, especially for the electric vehicle. Research teams, including Fraunhofer,* examine and evaluate various formats and the most promising cell types until 2025 will be the pouch and the 21700 cylindrical formats. Looking further, experts predict the large-size prismatic Li-ion cell to domineer in the EV battery market. Meanwhile, Samsung and others bet on the prismatic cell, LG gravitates towards the pouch format and Panasonic is most comfortable with the 18650 and 21700 cylindrical cells.\nLarge battery systems for ESS, UPS, marine vessels and traction use mostly large format pouch cells stacked with light pressure to prolong longevity and prevent delamination. Thermal management is often done by plates drawing the heat between layers to the outside and liquid cooling.\nOff-the-shelf cells have primarily been non-rechargeable and for public use. Typical applications are spares for flashlights, portable entertainment devices and remote controls. Accidental shorting with keys or coins in a jean pocket only causes an alkaline cell to heat up and not catch fire. The voltage collapses on an electrical short because of high internal resistance; removing the short stops the reaction. (See BU-304c: Battery Safety in Public)\nRechargeable cells are normally encapsulated in a for-purpose pack. The exception is the 18650 available as a spare cell for vaping. Looking like a large AA cell, these Li-ion cells can inflict acute injury, even death, if mishandled. If shorted, an unprotected Li-ion cell will vent with flame. Once the jet-like explosion is in progress, removing the short no longer stops the reaction and the cell burns out. Li-ion’s ability to deliver high power is a characteristic that must be respected. (See also BU-304c: Battery Safety in Public)\nThe 18650 cell can be made safe with built-in safety circuits described in BU-304b: Making Lithium-ion Safe. With protection, excessive current shuts the cell down, either momentarily by a heat element or permanently by an electric fuse. But the fused 18650 has the disadvantage of shutting down when high current is needed on purpose, such as vaping. Spare cells for vaping are normally unprotected.\nAnother cause of fire is low quality no-brand cells. Li-ion batteries are safe if made by a reputable manufacturer. Many aftermarket cells do not have the same rigorous safety checks as brand name products have. (See BU-810: What Everyone Should Know About Aftermarket Batteries) Cells can also be damaged by stress related to heat, shock, vibration and incorrect charging or loading.\nUnderwriters Laboratory (UL) may change the safety regulations by mandating that commercially available cells, like the 18650, cannot be removed by the customer.\n* Fraunhofer is Europe's largest research organization focusing on health, security, communication, energy and the environment.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Are batteries replaced too soon or too late? The answer lays in reliability concerns, service strategies and economics. While most batteries are replaced too late, Dr. Imre Gyuk, manager of the Energy Storage Research Program at DOE, says that every year roughly one million usable lithium-ion batteries are sent in for recycling with most having a capacity of up to 80%.\nDr. Gyuk is not alone. Mobile phone providers learned that 90% of returned warranty batteries have no problem. Packs are replaced on the slightest complaint without testing; installing a new pack seldom resolves the perceived problem. In the medical industry batteries are often replaced through date-stamping regardless of condition. Some packs are hardly used and are still in excellent health. A leading battery manufacturer discovered that 200 of 400 returned starter batteries had no problem. These organizations question the reason for the returns and the test methods used.\nWhile lead and cadmium-based batteries pose the largest environmental concerns, lithium-ion is being added to the list of pollutants for the first time. This chemistry was classified as only mildly toxic, but the sheer volume of Li-ion batteries in consumer products requires tighter scrutiny.\nIngenious entrepreneurs have discovered a business model in giving discarded batteries a second life. Refurbishment centers have sprung up in the USA, UK and Israel. A service center in Texas handles up to 700,000 mobile phone batteries per month. They purchase surplus batteries by the ton and check them with battery analyzers. Reports reveal that customers using these B-Class batteries serviced by Cadex battery analyzers have identical performance records to new packs; there are no recorded increases in returns. Figure 1 shows a box of incoming batteries to be serviced.\nFigure 1: Discarded mobile phonebatteries are tested and redistributed\nModern rapid-test methods enablequick service of incoming batteries.Storefronts also utilize thesetechnologies as part of customerservice.\nWith the advent of the electric powertrain, more batteries are becoming available for refurbishing. Although less than at 100% capacity, these rugged industrial batteries have plenty of life left to serve less demanding applications. GM and ABB are already using Chevrolet Volt battery packs to store electrical energy for grid use. A medical technician working in a large Michigan hospital uses spent batteries from patient heart pumps to cut the grass with an electric lawn mower. This makes green energy even greener.\nThe leading health indicator of a battery is capacity. Capacity determines the energy a battery can hold and suggests the price on a refurbished battery. Even if faded, an otherwise healthy Li-ion battery has a higher capacity than a new lead acid. Li-ion batteries for industrial use have a specific energy of about 120Wh/kg; lead acid is only at 40Wh/kg. A Li-ion battery dropping from 100% to 60% still has 72Wh/kg, a capacity that is substantially higher than lead acid. Furthermore, Li-ion will outlive lead acid if continuously cycled in a renewable energy application.\nBattery diagnostics has not advanced as quickly as other technologies and still appears to dwell in medieval times. No instrument is capable of estimating the state-of-health of a battery in a single measurement. Similar to a doctor examining a patient, or the weatherman forecasting the weather, battery testing entails looking at multiple attributes to get a clear health assessment. Although capacity is the leading health indicator, internal resistance and self-discharge also play a role. Suitable test equipment, understanding batteries and intuition are essential to make a refurbishing business viable.\nRapid-testing would be most desirable, but this only works for a designated battery population for which a matrix has been developed. A matrix is a multi-dimensional lookup table against which readings are compared. Text recognition, fingerprint identification and visual imaging operate in a similar principal. Mobile phone batteries fit the bill for rapid-testing and these packs can be checked with QuickSort™.\nDeveloped by Cadex, QuickSort™ uses electrochemical dynamic response to check the flow of ions between the cathode and anode of Li-ion. A digital load simulating a mobile phone excites the battery and the generic matrix classifies the battery into Good, Low and Poor. The test takes 30 seconds, is 90% accurate over a broad range of Li-ion systems and can be performed with a state-of-charge of 40–100%. The system does not rely on internal resistance as this would produce unreliable readings. Modern Li-ion keep low resistance with cycling, and Figure 2 illustrates this relationship.\nFigure 2: Relationship between capacity and resistance as part of cycling\nThe resistance of modern Lithium-ion remains low while the capacity gradually drops. Resistance measurements alone do not provide reliable results.\nCadex continues research to accommodate larger packs using Time Domain and Frequency Domain methods. Time domain applies a series of pulses (as in QuickSort™) and observes the rate of recovery. A good battery has as a quick recovery; a faded one is slow. An analogy can be made with a dry felt pen that still writes but needs rest to replenish the ink. Figure 3 compares a good battery with quick recovery against a faded one that is sluggish.\nFigure 3: Electrochemical dynamic response\nThe electrochemical dynamic response measures the ion flow between the positive and negative electrodes. A good battery has a quick recovery; a faded one is sluggish.\nFrequency domain is based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and involves scanning a battery with frequencies ranging from several kilohertz down to millihertz. High frequency reveals the resistive qualities of a battery, also known as bird-eye’s view, and low frequencies provide insight into unique battery characteristics, including capacity estimation with a suitable algorithm.\nEvaluating batteries at sub-hertz frequencies adds to the test time. At one millihertz, a cycle takes 1,000 seconds and several data points are required to assess a battery with certainty. Clever software simulation can shorten the duration to seconds by applying prediction models.\nResearch laboratories have been using EIS for many years to evaluate battery characteristics, but high equipment cost, long test times and the need for trained professionals to decipher reams of data have limited this technology to laboratory environments. In spite of its complexity, battery scientists believe that advanced battery testing will evolve around this very technology.\nCadex took the EIS technology a step further and developed multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy or Spectro™ for short. The handheld Spectro™ test devices developed by Cadex scan the lead acid battery with a 20-2,000 Hertz signal as if to take a landscape, but the heart of the system lays in the patented algorithm that performs 40 million transactions to calculate capacity and CCA readings in 15 seconds.\nNot all batteries can be checked with rapid-test methods. For the broad population of larger batteries, Cadex recommends battery analyzers to first establish if a battery is functional or not. A final capacity reading must always be known, and the most reliable method is through a full charge and discharge cycle. This method works well for deep-cycle lead acid, as well as nickel and lithium-based batteries, but should be avoided for starter batteries.\nServicing a broad range of batteries is best done with the Cadex C7000 Series. Figure 4 illustrates the C7400ER, a programmable battery analyzer servicing lead, nickel- and lithium-based batteries with ratings of up to 36V and 6A per channel to accommodate sizes of up to 24Ah. Each of the four stations operates independently. Redundant test algorithms assure safe service of batteries with a known fault.\nFigure 4: Cadex C7400ER battery analyzer\nProgrammable analyzers service batteries of up to 36V. Automated programs recognize a faulty battery and halt the service if necessary. The optional PC-BatteryShop™ enables PC interface.\nConnecting batteries has always been a challenge and Cadex solved this with battery adapters. Frequently used batteries are best serviced with a custom adapter. Each adapter holds 10 configuration codes to service batteries of same footprint. The parameters can be edited on the analyzer or with the optional PC-BatteryShop™ software.\nThe Smart Cable is best suited for a broad range of diverse batteries, and the RigidArm™ (Figure 5) is most convenient for mobile phone batteries. Spring-loaded arms meet the battery contacts from the top down, allowing quick and repetitive testing. The spring-loaded retractable floor holds the battery in a vertical position and a temperature sensor monitors the battery during the test.\nFigure 5: RigidArm™ for cellular batteries\nConnecting small batteries is simplified with the RigidArm™. This universal battery adapter meets the contacts from the top down, allowing repetitive testing with ease.\nBattery diagnostics and monitoring techniques are not advancing as rapidly as the global battery market demands. Much work lays ahead, and many companies, including Cadex, are making critical advances in the field. These incremental improvements will help extend battery life without sacrificing reliability. This is consistent with protecting our environment by being able to fully utilize the life of each battery and reducing the number of packs discarded.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Battery packs using Li-ion require a mandatory protection circuit to assure safety under (almost) all circumstances. Governed by IEC 62133, the safety of Li-ion cell or packs begins by including some or all of the following safeguards.\nThe PTC and CID work well in a smaller 2- or 3-cell pack with serial and parallel configuration, however, these safety devices are often omitted in larger multi-cell batteries, such as those for power tools, because the shutdown can occur in a cascade format. (See BU-302: Series and Parallel Battery Configurations) While some cells may go offline early, the load current causes excess current on the remaining cells. Such overload condition could lead to a thermal runaway before the remaining safety devices activate.\nIn addition to internal cell safeguards, an external electronic protection circuit prevents any cell from exceeding 4.30V on charge. In addition, a fuse cuts the current if the skin temperature of any cell approaches 90°C (194°F). To prevent the battery from over-discharging, a control circuit cuts off the current path at about 2.20V/cell.\nEach cell in a string needs independent voltage monitoring. The higher the cell count, the more complex the protection circuit becomes. Four cells in series had been the practical limit for consumer applications. Today, off-the-shelf chips also accommodate 5–7, 7–10 and 13 cells in series. For specialty applications, such as the hybrid or electric vehicle delivering several hundred volts, specialty protection circuits are made. Monitoring two or more cells in parallel to get higher current is less critical than controlling the voltage in a string configuration.\nProtection circuits can only shield abuse from the outside, such as an electrical short or faulty charger. If, however, a defect occurs within the cell, such as a contamination of microscopic metal particles, the external protection circuit has little effect and cannot arrest the reaction. Reinforced and self-healing separators are being developed for cells used in electric powertrains, but this makes the batteries large and expensive.Li-ion commonly discharges to 3.0V/cell. The lowest permitted “low-voltage” power cut-off is 2.5V/cell. It is not advised to keep the battery at that level as self-discharge could bring the cell to its cut-off voltage, causing the battery to go into sleep mode. Most chargers ignore Li-ion packs that have gone to sleep and a charge is no longer possible. (See BU-808a: How to Awaken Sleeping Li-ion)\nIn the ON position, the internal protection circuit has a resistance of 50–100mOhm, lower on power packs. The circuit typically consists of two switches connected in series; one is responsible for the high cut-off, and the other for the low cut-off. Larger packs need a more careful design than a smaller battery, and single cell packs for mobile phones and tablets get away with a voltage and current limit in addition to some intrinsic cell protection. (See BU-802a: How does Rising Internal Resistance affect Performance?)\nSome low-cost consumer chargers may rely solely on the battery’s protection circuit to terminate the charge. Redundancy is paramount for safety, and unknowingly to the buyer, low-cost consumer chargers may be offered that do not have properly functioning charge algorithms. This could be a vehicular charger for a mobile phone or an e-cigarette.\nA further concern arises if static electricity has destroyed the battery’s protection circuit. A shorted solid-state switch is permanently fused in the ON position without the user knowing. A battery with a faulty protection circuit functions normally but it fails to provide protection. The cell voltage could rise above a safe level and overcharge the battery. Heat buildup and bulging are early signs of malfunction, but some batteries explode without warning.\nLow prices make products from Asia attractive, but safety standards my not be equal to those in branded products. A wise shopper spends a little more money and buys recognized brands. (See BU-810: What Everyone Should Know about Aftermarket Batteries)\nFigure 1 shows batteries in equipment that disintegrated in a passenger aircraft before takeoff.\nMishap by air traveler who checked in Li-ion batteries undeclared that exploded before take-off. Shipping of lithium-based batteries is regulated under UN 38.3.\nManufacturers of lithium-ion batteries do not mention the word “explosion” but refer to “venting with flame” or “rapid disassembly.” Although seen as a slower and more controlled process than explosion, venting with flame or rapid disassembly can nevertheless be violent and inflict injury to those in close proximity.\n[1] Source: The Daily Telegraph; Sydney 23C-34C\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "The ultimate focus of maximizing the energy density of Li-ion shifted in 2006 when Li-ion unexpectedly disassembled in consumer products and millions of packs were recalled. Safety gained attention and batteries became safer. With the advent of the electric vehicle (EV), longevity is moving to the forefront and experts have begun exploring why batteries fail.\nWhile a 3-year battery life with 500 cycles is acceptable for laptops and mobile phones, the mandated 8-year life of an EV battery seems long at first. However, it still makes an EV buyer cringe when learning that a replacement battery carries the price of a compact car with an internal combustion engine. If the life of the battery could be extended to, say, 20 years, then driving an EV would be justified even if the initial investment is high.\nManufacturers of electric vehicles choose battery systems that are optimized for longevity rather than high specific energy. These batteries are normally larger and heavier than those used in consumer goods.\nBatteries chosen for an electric powertrain go through strenuous life cycle testing and Nissan selected a manganese-based Li-ion for the Leaf EV because of solid performance. To beat the clock, the test protocol mandated a rapid charge of 1.5C (less than 1 hour) and a discharge of 2.5C (20 minutes) under a temperature of 60°C (140°F). Under these harsh conditions, a heavy-duty battery is expected to lose 10 percent after 500 cycles, which represents 1–2 years of driving. This emulates driving an EV through the heat of a biblical hell, leaving rubber marks from aggressive driving, and still coming out with a battery that boasts 90 percent capacity.\nIn spite of the careful selection and extensive testing, the owners of the Nissan Leaf realized a capacity loss of 27.5 percent after 1–2 years of ownership, and this without aggressive driving. Why then would the Leaf under sheltered conditions drop the capacity by so much?\nTo get a better understanding of what causes irreversible capacity loss in Li-ion batteries, the Center for Automotive Research at the Ohio State University in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the National Institute of Standards and Technology performed forensic tests by dissecting failed batteries to find suspected problem areas on the electrodes.\nUnrolling a 1.5-meter-long (5 feet) strip of metal tape representing the anode and cathode coated with oxide revealed that the finely structured nanomaterials had coarsened. Further studies revealed that the lithium ions responsible for shuttling electric charge between the electrodes had diminished on the cathode and had permanently lodged on the anode. This resulted in the cathode having a lower lithium concentration than a new cell, a phenomenon that is irreversible.\nProfessor Jeff Dahn and his team at Dalhousie University in Halifax studied the longevity of Li-ion by examining coulombic efficiency (CE). CE defines the completeness by which electrons are transferred in an electrochemical system during charge and discharge. The higher the efficiency, the less stress there is on the battery and the longer it should live.\nDuring charge, lithium gravitates to the graphite anode (negative electrode) and the voltage potential changes. Removing the lithium again during discharge does not reset the battery fully. A film called solid electrolyte interface (SEI) consisting of lithium atoms forms on the surface of the anode. Composed of lithium oxide and lithium carbonate, the SEI layer grows as the battery cycles. The film gets thicker and eventually forms a barrier that obstructs interaction with graphite(See BU-701 How to Prime Batteries)\nThe cathode (positive electrode) develops a similar restrictive layer known as electrolyte oxidation. Dr. Dahn stresses that a voltage above 4.10V/cell at elevated temperature causes this, a demise that can be more harmful than cycling a battery. The longer the battery stays in a high voltage, the faster the degradation occurs.\nThe buildup can result in a sudden capacity loss that is difficult to predict by testing the duration of a battery through cycling alone. This phenomenon had been known for some years and measuring the coulombic efficiency can verify these effects in a more scientific and systematic manner than mere cycling.\nSimilar to an EV, Li-ion in satellites must also endure a lifespan of 8 years and more. To achieve this, the cells are charged to only 3.90V/cell and lower. An interesting discovery was made by NASA in that Li-ion dwelling above 4.10V/cell tend to decompose due to electrolyte oxidation on the cathode, while those charged to lower voltages lose capacity due to the SEI buildup on the anode.\nNASA reports that once Li-ion passes the 8 year mark after having delivered about 40,000 cycles in a satellite, cell deterioration caused by this phenomenon progresses quickly. Charging to 3.92V/cell appears to provide the best compromise in term of maximum longevity, but this reduces the capacity to only about 60 percent(See BU-808: How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries)\nCoulombic efficiency is capable of measuring both changes: the lithium lost due to SEI growth on the anode and electrolyte oxidation at the cathode. The results can be used to rank the life expectancy of a battery by quantifying the parasitic reaction.\nThe CE of a perfect battery would be 1.000,000. If this were the case, Dr. Dahn says, the Li-ion battery would last for ever. An excellent coulombic efficiency is 0.9999, a level that some lithium cobalt oxides (LCO) reach. By far the best Li-ion in terms of CE is lithium titanate (LTO); it has a potential to deliver 10,000 cycles. The negatives are high cost and relatively low specific energy. (See BU-205: Types of Lithium-ion.)\nThe coulombic efficiency readings vary with temperature and charge rate, also known as C-rate. As the cycle time gets longer, self-discharge comes into play and CE drops (gets worse). Electrolyte oxidation at the cathode, in part, causes this self-discharge. Li-ion loses about 2 percent per month at 0ºC (32ºF) with a state-of-charge of 50 percent and up to 35 percent at 60ºC (140ºF) when fully charged.\nTable 1 provides data for the most common Li-ion systems. For simplicity reasons, CE is described as excellent, good, moderate and poor taken at 30°C (86°F).\n1 Taken at C/20 (0.05C) and 30°C (86°F). (20h charge & discharge)2Cathode material3Anode material\nLithium-ion has improved and much credit goes to electrolyte additives. Each cell has several additives and manufacturers keep the combinations a secret. Additives lower internal resistance by reducing corrosion, decreasing gassing, speeding up manufacturing by fine-tuning the wetting process, and improving low and high temperature performance. Adding 1–2 percent vinylene carbonate improves SEI on the anode, limits electrolyte oxidation at the cathode and enhances the CE readings(See also BU-307: Electrolyte)\nAdditives make up less than 10 percent of the electrolyte and the chemicals are consumed in the formation of the SEI layer. Folks ask, “Can additives interact with each other?” The answer is, “Absolutely.” A battery behaves like a living organism and, as a patient taking multiple medications must inform the doctor before additional pills can be prescribed, similar conditions exist with a battery. Using coulombic efficiency allows the discovery of possible interferences in weeks rather than having to wait for years for symptoms to develop.\nTo examine the correlation between CE and longevity, Dalhousie University worked with battery manufacturers, including E-One Moli. While a university can carefully document ingredients, cell manufacturers keep these as top secret. The test bed consisted of 160 cells, four of each type. E-One Moli provided 80 cells with their own secret sauce; Dalhousie specified the other 80 electrolyte samples.\nDalhousie identified five batteries of interest, each with its own architecture and additives. Figure 2 shows the coulombic efficiency of these five samples with values ranging from 0.9960 to 0.9995. Figure 3 demonstrates the test results when cycled to death. To Dalhousie’s anticipation and satisfaction, CE harmonized well with the cycle count. Batteries with high CE lasted the longest; those with low CE values were the first to die.\nBattery wear and tear also includes structural degradation that can be captured with traditional cycle testing. Dr. Dahn calls this type of testing the “sausage machine.” While measuring Coulombic efficiency assists in battery development by giving a snapshot assessment of additives; the old sausage machine does the verification thereafter.\nFigure 4 demonstrates capacity loss caused by the structural degradation of an older Li-ion when cycled at a 1C, 2C and 3C. The elevated capacity loss at higher C-rates may be lithium plating at the anode caused by rapid charging(See BU-401a: Fast and Ultra-fast chargers)\nWhen choosing batteries for the powertrains, manufacturers of electric vehicles come to different conclusions. Tesla cars use the 18650 cell because the cell is readily available and has a low price. This was a strange choice for the Tesla Roadster, the first EV by Tesla, as the cell was designed for portable devices such as laptops and medical and military devices. Perhaps unknown to Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla Motors, cobalt-blended lithium-ion has a high CE reading that adds to longevity in the way the battery is being used in that application.\nThe newer Tesla models use the same concept and to reduce stress, Tesla “super-sizes” the pack. The battery is so large that it operates at a C-rate of only 0.25C (C/4), even at highway speed. This allows Tesla to focus on high energy density for maximum runtime; power density becomes less important. The negative of super-sizing is increased energy consumption due to a heavier vehicle and a higher battery price. (For more information on EV battery choices see BU-1003: Electric Vehicle)\nThe manganese-based Li-ion batteries chosen for the Nissan Leaf and other EVs have excellent lab results. What may have been overlooked in the Nissan Leaf test is the damage that is being done when keeping the battery at high voltage and elevated temperature. As the coulombic efficiency tests reveal, these two conditions can cause more damage than cycling.The four suspected renegades responsible for capacity loss and the eventual end-of-life of the Li-ion battery are:\n[1] Courtesy of the Dalhousie University\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

(PWM controlled shunting is a kind of nondissipative shunting method. In this method, the Battery Management System (BMS) senses the voltage difference of the two neighboring cells, by applying a PWM square wave on the gating of the pair of TRANSISTOR's, the BMS controls the current difference of the two neighboring cells. As a result, the average current flows through the higher voltage cell will be lower than the normal cell.) When I gave the PWM signal, my cell voltage is decreasing. But after end of the PWM signal my cell is encreasing. Even I tried to remove the cell from the system. But it didn't work. Why my cell voltage is increasing after the balancing.\nThese are easy to calculate if you know the battery size.  A Model 3 is about 75KWH.\nSo, 11.5kw charge rate would be 11.5/75 or about 0.15C\nA Tesla 250KW supercharger would be 250/75 or about 3C\nOk! So Tesla battery C rate is about  0.25C (C/4) on discharge...  But what is it when charging at 50 amps 240v (11.5kW)? Or worse yet, their level 3 charger at 240v and who knows how many amps? And how does that impact battery longevity?\nAround 2014, Nissan changed the design and/or chemistry of the Leaf's batteries.

        "content": "Most laptop batteries are smart and consist of the “chemical battery” that is managed by the “digital battery.” A common protocol is the System Management Bus, better known as SMBus.\nThe typical SMBus battery has five or more battery connections consisting of positive and negative battery terminals, thermistor, clock and data. The connections are often unmarked; however, the positive and negative are commonly located at the outer edges of the connector and the inner contacts accommodate the clock and data. (The one-wire system combines clock and data.) For safety reasons, a separate thermistor wire is brought to the outside. Figure 1 illustrates a battery with six connections.\nThe positive and negative terminals are usually placed on the outside; no norm exists on the arrangement of the other contacts.\nSome batteries are equipped with a solid-state switch that is normally in the “off” position and no voltage is present at the battery terminals. Connecting the switch terminal to ground or pulling it up often turns the battery on. If this does not work, the pack may need a code for activation. Battery manufacturers keep these proprietary codes a well-guarded secret to which even service personnel have no access.\nUse a voltmeter to locate the positive and negative battery terminals and establish the polarity. If no voltage is present, a solid-state switch may be in the “off” position and needs activating. Connect the voltmeter to the outer terminals, take a 100-Ohm resistor (other values may also work), tie one end to ground and with the other end touch each terminal while observing the voltmeter. Repeat by tying the resistor to a positive voltage potential. If there is no response, then it is possible that the battery is dead or locked by a code. The 100-Ohm resistor is low enough to engage a digital circuit and high enough to protect the battery against a possible electrical short.\nEstablishing the connection to the battery terminals should now enable charging. If the charge current stops after 30 seconds, an activation code may be required. Some battery manufacturers add an end-of-battery-life switch that turns the battery off when reaching a certain age or cycle count. They argue that customer satisfaction and safety can only be guaranteed by regularly replacing the battery. Mind you, such a policy also rotates inventory.\nIf at all possible, connect the thermistor during charging and discharging to protect the battery against possible overheating. Use an ohmmeter to locate the internal thermistor. The most common thermistors are 10 Kilo Ohm NTC, which reads 10kΩ at 20C (68F). NTC stands for negative temperature coefficient, meaning that the resistance decreases with rising temperature. In comparison, a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) causes the resistance to increase. Warming the battery with your hand is sufficient to detect a small change in resistor value when looking for the correct terminal on the battery.\nAfter repair, the fuel gauge might not work, is inaccurate or provides wrong information. The battery may need some sort of an initialization/calibration process by fully charging and discharging the pack to reset the flags. A “flag” is a measuring point to mark and record an event(See BU-603: How to Calibrate a “Smart” Battery)\nThe circuits of some smart batteries must be kept “alive” during the replacement of the cells. Disconnecting the voltage for only a fraction of a second can erase vital data in the memory. An analogy is open-heart surgery where doctors must keep all organs of the patient alive. The lost data could contain the resistor value of the digitized shunt that is responsible for the coulomb counter and other data.\nTo assure continued operation when changing the cells, supply a secondary voltage of same voltage level through a 100-Ohm resistor to the circuit before disconnection. Remove the outside supply only after the circuit receives voltage again from the new cells. Furthermore, some fuel gauge chips run wires to each cell. These must be reassembled in the correct sequence beginning with cell one, then two, three and so forth.\nYou will also need to be aware of compliance issues. Unlike other regulated standards, the SMBus allows variations and this can cause problems. The repaired SMBus battery should be checked for compatibility with the charger. Batteries for critical uses, such as heathcare, are typically replaced and not repaired.

        "title": "BU-504: How to Verify Sufficient Battery Capacity",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-504-how-to-verify-sufficient-battery-capacity",
        "content": "A battery performs well when new but the capacity soon begins to fade with use and time. To assure reliable service during the life span of the battery, design engineers oversize the pack to include some spare capacity. This is similar to carrying extra fuel in an airplane to enable a waiting pattern or attempt a second landing approach when so required.\nNew batteries operate (should operate) at a capacity of 100 percent; replacement occurs when the packs fade to about 80 percent. All batteries must include a secure level of spare capacity to cover worst-case scenarios.\nIn addition to normal capacity fade, cold temperature lowers the capacity, especially Li-ion. The capacity loss of a Li-ion Energy Cell is about 17 percent at 0°C (32°F), 34 percent at –10°C (14°F) and 47 percent at –20°C (–4°F). Power Cells perform better at cold temperature with lower cold-related capacity losses than Energy Cells.\nLack of spare capacity is a common cause of system failures. This commonly happens during heavier than normal traffic or in an emergency. During routine operations, marginal batteries can hide comfortably among their peers, but they will fail when put to the test. A battery maintenance program as part of quality control assures that all batteries in the fleet are within the required performance range.\nFigure 1 illustrates the breakdown of a battery that includes capacity fade and spare capacity. Adding 20 percent for fade and 20 percent for spare as a safety net leaves only 60 percent for the actual capacity. Such a generous allowance may not be practical in all cases.\nSpare capacity should be calculated for a worst-case scenario. The allowable capacity range is 80-100%; a spare capacity of 20 percent is recommended for critical use. Allow more capacity reserve when operating at cold temperature.\nTo verify sufficient spare capacity in a battery fleet, identify batteries that are close to retirement and spot-check their capacities after a busy day with a battery analyzer. The Cadex analyzer provides this function on the “Prime” program in that it applies a discharge before charge. The first reading on the display reflects the spare capacity and the second represents the full capacity after a charge.\nIf packs with fringe capacity levels come back from a full-day shift with less than 10 percent of spare capacity, raise the pass/fail target capacity from 80 to 85 percent to gain five extra points. If, on the other hand, these old-timers come back with 30 percent before charging, keep them longer by lowering the target capacity to, say, 70 percent. Knowing the energy needs for each application during a typical shift increases battery transparency. This improves reliability and creates a sweet spot between risk management and economics.\nWhile most batteries are replaced when the capacity fades to 80 percent, scanners in some warehouses can be kept longer because they may not require all available capacity during an 8-hour shift. If this is the case, the target capacity can safely be set to 70 percent while maintaining ample spare capacity. A starter battery in a vehicle still cranks the motor with a capacity of 40 percent. The discharge is short and the battery recharges right away. Allowing the capacity to drop much further might prevent the battery from turning the engine on a cold morning, stranding the driver.

        "title": "Ultra-fast Charging",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/ultra-fast-charging",
        "content": "Consumers demand faster charging times. Leading in this movement is the electric vehicle (EV) industry that strives for charge times similar to filling up a vehicle at a gas station. Pumping 50 liters (13 gallons) of fuel into a tank holds a calorific value of 600kWh. The fill-up is quick. An EV battery, in comparison, only stores between 50–100kWh of energy and charging takes a long time.\nCharging an EV will always take longer than filling a tank with fuel; the battery will always deliver less energy per weight than fossil fuel. A modern Li-ion for EVs produces up to 250Wh per kg; energy from fossil fuel is 13,000Wh/kg, 50 times higher. The advantages of the electric drive are high energy efficiency and clean power. These are valid reasons to switch to electric propulsion.\nUltra-fast charging is a necessity for inter-city travel but it has two drawbacks. One is the expensive power feed of up to 120kW per station that equals the power needs of five households. A less mentioned disadvantage is the stress induced on the battery when ultra-fast charging.\nMost EVs can be charged with three charging systems.\nThe battery is an electrochemical device that can only absorb a given amount of energy. Charging Li-ion occurs by intercalation of lithium ions and electrons on the electrodes. Trying to push more energy into Li-ion than it can effectively absorb creates an over-feed condition. Metallic lithium builds up on the anode, resulting in lithium plating that forms dendrites which compromises safety and shortens battery life. The same symptoms also occur when charging Li-ion at cold temperatures when the intercalation is slowed.\nCharge acceptance is governed by cell design, and Li-ion comes in two versions. The Power Cells with its large surface area permits high load currents and fast-charging. This cell is used for power tools and less for EVs because of low specific energy. The more common Energy Cell has a high specific energy (capacity) but its current handling is limited; it also requires longer charging times that the Power Cell. The EV battery is a hybrid gravitating towards the Energy Cell for high capacity and long range.\nThe exception is lithium-titanate, a lithium-based battery that can be fast-charged. This is made possible by replacing the carbon anode of a regular Li-ion with lithium-titanate nanocrystals that offers far greater surface area, allowing electrons to enter and leave the anode quickly. Li-titanate is used by some Japanese EVs, but the battery system is expensive and has a lower capacity than regular Li-ion.\nTo achieve fast charging and long driving ranges, the EV battery is being oversized, and the Tesla S 85 is such an example. Supercharging its 90kWh battery dumps about 90kW into the battery. This represents a charge C-rate of 1C for a time. As the battery fills, the C-rate falls to a more comfortable 0.8C, and then goes further down, avoiding harmful battery stress that is related to ultra-fast charging.\nPeople ask, “Why does an ultra-fast charger only charge a battery to 70 and 80 percent?” The simple answer is, charge acceptance is best in mid-range; battery stresses are also reduced in mid-range.\nWhen putting the battery on charge, the voltage shoots up. This behavior is similar to lifting a weight with a rubber band in which the weight, or charge, lags behind. Depending on charge times, Li-ion is about 70 percent charged when reaching 4.20V/cell, a voltage threshold that is common with Li-ion. At this phase, the current begins to taper and charge acceptance slows.\nUltra-fast charging Li-ion must meet these conditions to minimize stress and maintain safety:\nIncreasing the charge current is simple — assessing how much energy a battery can absorb is more difficult. An analogy is a high-speed train traveling at 300km per hour (188 mph) on a good track. Powerful motors are easy to build, but it’s ultimately the track that governs the speed. In the same manner, the condition of the battery dictates charging times.\nA well designed ultra-fast charger evaluates the battery condition to match the charge current with the abortion rate. The charger should also adjust to temperature and observe cell balance. Furthermore, the recommended ultra-fast charger should have three settings: Overnight Charge (0.5C); Fast Charge (0.8–1C) and Ultra-fast Charge (above 1C). This allows the user to limit ultra-fast charging to only when needed and at a suitable temperature. While such a charger may not yet exist, basic battery knowledge and common sense should prevail when charging batteries in an unconventional way.\nIt is best not to fully charge Li-ion. Every reduction in peak voltage of 0.10V/cell is said to double the cycle life. (See How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries.) This is why EVs only operate the battery between 30 and 80 percent SoC when new. The BMS widens the SoC bandwidth as the battery ages to maintain the desired driving range. Equally important are cool temperatures and moderate charge rates.\nEuropean governments have set an end-date for the internal combustion engine (ICE) in cars. It took 100 years to build the fossil fuel infrastructure, and it may take equally long to switch to electric propulsion. Private enterprises built gas stations; in many regions today tax payers subsidize charging stations and the purchase of an EV. Commuters biking to work or taking transit see this handout as dismay because they pay double.\nAn important issue that is being overlooked by rule makers is assuring the suitability of a battery in an EV. The Tesla S 85 battery weighs 540kg (1,200 lb). In comparison, a gasoline engine is 130 to 350kg (300 to 800 lbs). Furthermore, the battery is the weakest component in most devices; its longevity is often lower than the host it powers. Take a battery-operated drill that is wonderful when new but the battery is the first to go. Replacement packs, if available, are expensive and a good drill is often discarded prematurely.\nAs the EV replaces cars with combustion engines, we ask: “Will the EV hold its value? Will the EV eventually match the price and driving range of a regular car? How will the battery perform when the 8-year warranty expires? Will replacing the pack be economical or will the car be discarded similar to an old mobile phone or electric tooth brush when the battery goes? What environmental problems will develop disposing of large EV batteries?\nBatteries for the EV are of higher quality than those in consumer products and experts say that the EV battery will outlive the car. Lab tests have proven this to be true but the real test comes when the shiny new EVs age. Civilized driving, moderate temperatures and good charging practices help prolong battery life.\nEV buyers will, however, cringe when learning that a replacement battery carries the price of a compact car with an internal combustion engine. Regulatory officials should assure that replacement batteries are available at a reasonable cost, lest the EV becomes a disposable item alike a cordless drill or smartphone when the battery dies.\nCompanies have sprung up that test EV batteries past retirement for reuse in secondary applications. (See Giving Batteries a Second Life). Typical uses are energy storage for solar panels in residences. Not enough information is available on the viability and safety of these batteries in a second life.\nBattery users have a strong desire to prolong the life of a battery and here are recommendations of what the battery custodian can do:\nGas Evolution during Unwanted Lithium Plating in Li-Ion Cells with EC-based or EC-free Electrolytes.By Q.

        "title": "Will the Fuel Cell have a Second Life?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/will-the-fuel-cell-have-a-second-life",
        "content": "The fuel cell enjoyed the height of popularity in the1990s when scientists and stock promoters envisioned a world run on clean and inexhaustible resource – hydrogen. They predicted cars running on fuel cells and households generating electricity from back-yard fuel cells. Improvements in stack design during that time led to increased power densities and lower costs. The stock prices skyrocketed and promoters got blinded. High manufacturing costs, marginal performance and short service life stood in the way of turning the hydrogen dream into reality. Hype and investment funding has since moderated and we hope that a more sensible approach will eventually find the proper use for the fuel cell.Before resetting expectations, it had been said that the fuel cell is as revolutionary in transforming the world as the microprocessor had been. Experts uttered further that using an inexhaustible source of fuel, hydrogen, would improve the quality of life, and environmental concerns of burning fossil fuels would be solved forever. From 1999 through 2001, over 2,000 organizations were actively involved in fuel cell development and four of the largest public fuel cell companies in North American raised more than a billion dollars in public stock offerings. What went wrong? Is burning hydrogen instead of fossil fuel a misconception? Let’s look at this closer. A fuel cell is twice as efficient to convert carbon fuel to electricity than combustion does. Hydrogen, the simplest element consisting of one proton and one electron, is plentiful and exceptionally clean as a fuel. Hydrogen makes up 90 percent of the universe and is the third most abundant element on the earth’s surface. Such a wealth of fuel would provide an almost unlimited pool of energy at relatively low cost, but there is a hitch. The fuel cell core (stack) that converts oxygen and hydrogen to electricity is expensive to build and hydrogen is more costly to produce than gasoline in terms of net calorific value (NCV). Some say that hydrogen is nearly energy neutral, meaning that it takes as much energy to produce as it delivers at the end destination. Unless the energy source used to produce hydrogen comes from a renewable source, hydrogen will not solve the energy issue, nor will it reduce the carbon footprint. Hydrogen is not a source of energy per se but represents a medium to transport and store it. When envisioning “burning an endless supply of hydrogen,” we must first produce the resource. Hydrogen is not abundantly available in the earth ready to use, as oil and natural gas is and needs other energies to make it into a usable product, similar to electricity to charge a battery. If electricity produces hydrogen, then this energy source should come from a renewable resource. This is not always the case and much comes is derived from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Fossil fuel lends itself well to produce hydrogen, however, converting this valuable fuel to hydrogen does not make much sense when considering that the process does not add much value. Seen from this angle, hydrogen cannot compete with fossil fuel pumped “free” from the earth as a gift to humanity.\nFuel storage is a further disadvantage. Liquid hydrogen has a low energy density and the volumetric storage in terms of energy is about five times less than petrol products. In liquid form, hydrogen needs extensive insulation for cold keeping, and in gaseous form pressurized hydrogen requires heavy storage tanks. A reformer would allow the use of methanol, propane, butane and natural gas, however, when converting these fossil fuels into pure hydrogen, some leftover carbon is being released. Although 90 percent less potent than what comes from the tailpipe of a car, carrying a reformer adds to vehicle weight and increases cost. In addition, reformers are known to be sluggish and the net benefit of the fuel cell over the internal combustion engine diminishes.Sir William Grove, a Welsh judge and gentleman scientist developed the fuel cell concept in 1839, but the invention never took off. This was in part due to the rapidly advancing internal combustion engine that promised better early results. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that the fuel cell was put to practical use during the Gemini space program in the 1960s. NASA preferred this clean power source to nuclear or solar energy and the alkaline fuel cell system that was chosen generated electricity and produced the drinking water for the astronauts. High material cost made the fuel cell prohibitive for commercial use at that time. This did not hinder Dr. Karl Kordesch, the co-inventor of the alkaline battery, from converting his car to an alkaline fuel cell in the early 1970s. Kordesch drove his car for many years in Ohio, USA. He placed the hydrogen tank on the roof and utilized the trunk for the fuel cell as well as back-up batteries. According to Kordesch, there was “enough room for four people and a dog.” A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that combines hydrogen fuel with oxygen to produce electricity, heat and water. The fuel cell is similar to a battery in that an electrochemical reaction takes place as long as fuel is available. The hydrogen fuel is stored in a pressurized container and oxygen is taken from the air. Because of the absence of a burning process, there are no harmful emissions, and the only byproduct is fresh water. The water emitted from the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is so pure that visitors of Vancouver’s Ballard Power Systems were being served hot tea made from this clean water. Fundamentally, a fuel cell is electrolysis in reverse, using two electrodes separated by an electrolyte. The anode (negative electrode) gets the hydrogen and the cathode (positive electrode) the oxygen. A catalyst at the anode separates hydrogen into positively charged hydrogen ions and electrons, the oxygen is ionized and migrates across the electrolyte to the anodic compartment where it combines with hydrogen. A single fuel cell produces 0.6 to 0.8V under load. To obtain higher voltages, several cells are connected in series.As there are different battery chemistries, so also are there several fuel cell systems to choose from. In Table 1, we summarize the advantages and limitations of the most common fuel cells. The developments refer to the time of writing.\nType of Fuel Cell\nApplications\nAdvantages\nLimitations\nStatus\nProton Exchange Membrane(PEMFC)\nMedium to large systems for portable, stationary and automotive.\nCompact design; long operating life; offers quick start-up, 50% efficient.\nExpensive to build; needs pure hydrogen, complex heat and water management.\nPractical and most widely developed.\nAlkaline(AFC)\nSpace (NASA), terrestrial transport, submarines.\nLow manufacturing, operation costs; no compressor, fast cathode kinetics.\nLarge size; needs pure hydrogen and oxygen.\nNew interest due to low manufacturing, operating costs.\nMolten Carbonate(MCFC)\nLarge-scale power generation.\nEfficient; co-generation utilizes heat to run turbines\nElectrolyte instability; limited service life.\nWell developed; semi-commercial.\nPhosphoric Acid(PAFC)\nMedium to large power generation.\nLenient to fuels; for co-generation.\nLow efficiency, limited service life, expensive catalyst.\nIn competition with PEMFC.\nSolid Oxide(SOFC)\nMedium to large power generation.\nLenient to fuels, feeds, uses natural gas; 60% efficient with co-generation.\nHigh temperatures; exotic metals; high manufacturing costs, short life.\nNew material, stack design sets off renewed development.\nDirect Methanol(DMFC)\nPortable, mobile and stationary use.\nCompact; feeds directly off methanol; no compressor.\nComplex stack, slow load response; 20% efficient.\nLimited production.\nTable 1: Advantages and disadvantages of various fuel cell systems. The development of the fuel cell has not advanced at the same pace as batteries and a direct replacement is not yet feasible.\nFuel cells for automotive use the Proton Exchange Membrane, or PEM for short. PEM uses a polymer electrolyte and is one of the furthest developed and most commonly used fuel cell systems today. The PEM system allows compact design and achieves a high energy to weight ratio. Another advantage is the relatively quick start-up when applying hydrogen. The stack runs at a moderate temperature of about 80°C (176°F) and has a 50-percent efficiency. (In comparison, the internal compaction motor is only about 25 percent efficient).The limitations of the PEM fuel cell are high manufacturing costs and complex water management systems. The stack contains hydrogen, oxygen and water and if dry, water must be added to get the system going; too much water causes flooding. The system requires pure hydrogen; lower fuel grades can cause decomposition of the membrane. Testing and repairing a stack is difficult and this becomes apparent when realizing that a 150V, 50kW stack to power a car requires 250 cells.Extreme operating temperatures are a further challenge. Freezing water can damage the stack and the manufacturer recommends heating elements to prevent ice formation. When cold, the start-up is slow and at first the performance is poor. Excessive heat can also cause damage and controlling the operating temperatures, as well as supplying enough oxygen requires compressors, pumps and other accessories that consume about 30 percent of the energy generated. If operated in a vehicle, the PEMFC stack has an estimated service life of 2000-4000 hours. Start and stop conditions, induce drying and wetting, contribute to membrane stress. Running continuously, the stationary stack is good for about 40,000 hours. Stack replacement is a major expense. Even with these limitations, the fuel cell as propulsion system is in many ways superior to batteries. It reduces the need to carry large batteries, a necessity with a vehicle propelled by batteries alone. Figure 2 illustrates the practical travel range of a vehicle powered by a fuel cell compared to lead acid, NiMH or Li-ion batteries. One can clearly note that lead and nickel-based batteries gets too heavy when increasing the size to enable larger driving distances. In this respect, the fuel cell enjoys similar qualities to the IC engine in that it can conquer large distances with only the extra weight of fuel.\nFigure 2: Driving range as a function of energy storage.\nThe logarithmical curves of battery power places limitations in terms of size and weight when increasing the distances between charge. In comparison, the fuel cell and IC engine share a linear progression.\nNote: 35 MPa hydrogen tank refers to 5,000 psi pressure; 70 MPa is 10,000 psi\nCourtesy of International Journal of Hydrogen Energy\nAlthough the fuel cell assumes the duty of the IC engine in a vehicle, poor response time and a weak power band make onboard batteries necessary. In this respect, the FC car resembles an electric vehicle with an onboard power aggregate to keep the batteries charged. The battery is the master and the fuel cell becomes the slave. On start-up, the vehicle relies 100 percent on the battery and the fuel cell only begins contributing after reaching the steady state in 5-30 seconds. During the warm-up period, the battery must also deliver power to activate the air compressor and pumps. When warm, the FC provides enough power for cruising, and when accelerating or climbing hills both FC and battery provide power. During breaking, the kinetic energy is being returned to charge the battery. The FC of a mid-sized car generates around 85kW, or 114hp, and the power couples to an electric motor of similar capacity. The onboard battery has a capacity of around 18kW and provide throttle response and power assist when passing vehicles or climbing hills. The battery serves a buffer similar to the HEV and does not get stressed by repeated deep cycling and fast charging, as is the case with the EV. Hydrogen costs about twice as much as gasoline but the high efficiency of the FC compared to the IC engine in converting fuel to energy gives the same net effect on the pocket book except less greenhouse gases and reduced pollution. Hydrogen is commonly derived from natural gas and we ask why not burning natural gas directly in the IC engine instead of converting it to hydrogen through a reformer and then transforming it to electricity in a fuel cell to feed the electric motors? The answer is efficiency. Burning natural gas in a combustion turbine to produce electricity has an efficiency factor of only 26-32 percent, while using a FC is 35-50 percent efficient. We must keep in mind that the machinery required with the clean FC is far more expensive and requires added maintenance than simply using a burning process. We have no hydrogen infrastructure and building it is prohibitive. Refueling stations reforming natural gas to hydrogen to support 2,300 vehicles cost over $2 million to build. In comparison, a charging outlet for the EV is less the $1000, but the refill time would be longer than with the FC. Meanwhile, we have plenty of gas stations that offer a quick fill-up of cheap fuel. Durability and cost are other concerns with the fuel cell and here we have seen some encouraging improvements. The service life of a FC in car driven in normal traffic conditions has doubled from 1,000 hours to 2,000 hours. The target for 2015 is 5,000 hours, or the full life of a vehicle driving 240,000 km (150,000 miles). Another challenge is cost. The fuel cell costs substantially more than an IC engine and until mass-produced, pricing for a cost comparisons is impractical to make. As a simple guideline, the FC vehicles will be more expensive than plug-in hybrids, and the plug-in hybrid cost more than a regular gasoline powered car. It is conceivable that the fuel cell will never become the engine of choice that experts had hoped and there could be similarities with the failed attempt to fly airplanes on a steam engine in the mid 1800s. It is, however, everyone’s desire that the fuel cell will succeed, and taxpayers may one day have to pay to open the markets similar to subsidizing the electric car. It is also conceivable that governments might in the future mandate the use of fuel cells for environmental reasons. Fuel cells could also become the energy source of choice once the supply of fossil fuel gets dangerously low. Meanwhile, we hope that the development of the fuel cell will continue and become a replacement for the polluting internal combustion engine.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "A device manufacturer must over-size a battery to allow for capacity to fade. Systems work well when new but concerns arise as battery capacity decreases, a loss that often happens in an uncontrolled way.\nChargers are available that offer Minimum Operational Reserve Energy (MORE) to track capacity fade. This permits the full use of each battery and prompts replacement while packs are still functional.\nMORE tracks Leftover Charge that should be between 10% and 20% at the end of a regular shift. Setting up MORE, the Supervisor chooses the Leftover Charge to optimize system reliability while striving for long battery life. An analogy for Leftover Charge is checking the fuel reserve when landing an aircraft.\nLeftover Charge is set by the Target Selector in the charger. If low at the end of a day, the target should be set higher to increase the energy backup, but if plenty of charge is left before charge, the setting can be relaxed to keep batteries longer. Figure 1 exhibits a MORE setting of 80% on a partially faded battery that keeps some spare.\nThe charger in question works in standalone; MORE is available by connecting the charger to a PC to reveal performance data from smart batteries. This enables the supervisor to make changes on Leftover Charge with the Target Selector. Connecting to Analytics as illustrated in Figure 2 checks battery longevity relating to usage and environmental stress on data being stored.\nIn standalone mode, the green SoH Light on the Universal Supervisor Charger (USC) by Cadex illuminates when FCC meets the Target Selector on insertion. FCC (Full Charge Capacity) represents the digital capacity of a smart battery, a battery performance check that is made available to the user. Amber calls for service in the form of calibration that the user can do in-unit when time permits. If calibration fails to reach target capacity, the battery should be retired.\nConnecting the USC to a host displays battery state-of-function by the Fishbowl as shown in Figure 4. The outer ring shows state-of-charge that moves clock-wise on charge and counter-clockwise on discharge. The Status Dome reveals the battery state, and the hanging black ceiling tracks capacity fade that slowly drops towards the redline of the Target Selector with use. Touching the Dome shows the detailed data of a smart battery.\nOf importance is Leftover Charge that verifies battery performance for each unique application.\nThe ultimate goal in risk management is predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a battery. This level of diagnostics involves assessing the usable battery energy, observing capacity fade and securing minimum energy that MORE provides with minimal user interaction using Cloud Analytics.\nCloud Analytics provides transparency by revealing Leftover Charge and the Energy used that is set against the Target Capacity to show RUL in years. This visualization illustrated in Figure 5 is made possible by connecting the USC to the CadexCloud.\nLine Products that Cloud Analytics supports also include next-gen battery analyzers and compatible rapid testers that can be configured in a vertical or horizontal system.\nThe Vertical System shown in Figure 6 interfaces to the cloud by Ethernet or Wi-Fi to form a professional battery charging and servicing system that can be expanded to 120 channels. Each unit can run on its own program with central control from the host.\nThe Horizontal System shown in Figure 7 serves local uses to operate in Level 2 with option to connect to the cloud with Level 3. If communication is by USB, this system is limited to the number of ports on a given host.\nLevel 2 in the horizontal system is free of charge; Level 3 is by subscription. Cost-sensitive chargers with USB ports alone are reserved with the Horizontal System.\nThe lone charger perceived as a necessary evil is taking on a supervisory role. MORE running in the background will serve healthcare, defense, public safety, warehousing, transportation and mining with minimal user intervention. Other applications benefiting from MORE are power tools, robots, drones and equipment rentals to prevent unexpected down-time. UN and EU regulators also realize the importance of knowing the usable battery energy and are working on battery state-of-health standards.\nBatteries share similarities with machinery, a service controlled by Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM). Early RCM applications were the Boeing 747 implemented in the late 1960’s, a simplification in maintenance that expanded to defense, nuclear power plants, oil & gas, subways and hospitals. To avoid innovative blind spots in the haste to electrify, batteries also need an RCM type care from workforce to retirement to secure reliability and safety.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-409: Charging Lithium-ion",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-409-charging-lithium-ion",
        "content": "Charging and discharging batteries is a chemical reaction, but Li-ion is claimed to be the exception. Battery scientists talk about energies flowing in and out of the battery as part of ion movement between anode and cathode. This claim carries merits but if the scientists were totally right, then the battery would live forever. They blame capacity fade on ions getting trapped, but as with all battery systems, internal corrosion and other degenerative effects also known as parasitic reactions on the electrolyte and electrodes still play a role. (See BU-808b: What causes Li-ion to die?)\nThe Li ion charger is a voltage-limiting device that has similarities to the lead acid system. The differences with Li-ion lie in a higher voltage per cell, tighter voltage tolerances and the absence of trickle or float charge at full charge. While lead acid offers some flexibility in terms of voltage cut off, manufacturers of Li-ion cells are very strict on the correct setting because Li-ion cannot accept overcharge. The so-called miracle charger that promises to prolong battery life and gain extra capacity with pulses and other gimmicks does not exist. Li-ion is a “clean” system and only takes what it can absorb.\nLi-ion with the traditional cathode materials of cobalt, nickel, manganese and aluminum typically charge to 4.20V/cell. The tolerance is +/–50mV/cell. Some nickel-based varieties charge to 4.10V/cell; high capacity Li-ion may go to 4.30V/cell and higher. Boosting the voltage increases capacity, but going beyond specification stresses the battery and compromises safety. Protection circuits built into the pack do not allow exceeding the set voltage.\nFigure 1 shows the voltage and current signature as lithium-ion passes through the stages for constant current and topping charge. Full charge is reached when the current decreases to between 3 and 5 percent of the Ah rating.\nLi-ion is fully charged when the current drops to a set level. In lieu of trickle charge, some chargers apply a topping charge when the voltage drops.\nThe advised charge rate of an Energy Cell is between 0.5C and 1C; the complete charge time is about 2–3 hours. Manufacturers of these cells recommend charging at 0.8C or less to prolong battery life; however, most Power Cells can take a higher charge C-rate with little stress. Charge efficiency is about 99 percent and the cell remains cool during charge.\nSome Li-ion packs may experience a temperature rise of about 5ºC (9ºF) when reaching full charge. This could be due to the protection circuit and/or elevated internal resistance. Discontinue using the battery or charger if the temperature rises more than 10ºC (18ºF) under moderate charging speeds.\nFull charge occurs when the battery reaches the voltage threshold and the current drops to 3 percent of the rated current. A battery is also considered fully charged if the current levels off and cannot go down further. Elevated self-discharge might be the cause of this condition.\nIncreasing the charge current does not hasten the full-charge state by much. Although the battery reaches the voltage peak quicker, the saturation charge will take longer accordingly. With higher current, Stage 1 is shorter but the saturation during Stage 2 will take longer. A high current charge will, however, quickly fill the battery to about 70 percent.\nLi-ion does not need to be fully charged as is the case with lead acid, nor is it desirable to do so. In fact, it is better not to fully charge because a high voltage stresses the battery. Choosing a lower voltage threshold or eliminating the saturation charge altogether, prolongs battery life but this reduces the runtime. Chargers for consumer products go for maximum capacity and cannot be adjusted; extended service life is perceived less important.\nSome lower-cost consumer chargers may use the simplified “charge-and-run” method that charges a lithium-ion battery in one hour or less without going to the Stage 2 saturation charge. “Ready” appears when the battery reaches the voltage threshold at Stage 1. State-of-charge (SoC) at this point is about 85 percent, a level that may be sufficient for many users.\nCertain industrial chargers set the charge voltage threshold lower on purpose to prolong battery life. Table 2 illustrates the estimated capacities when charged to different voltage thresholds with and without saturation charge. (See also BU-808: How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries)\nAdding full saturation at the set voltage boosts the capacity by about 10 percent but adds stress due to high voltage.\nWhen the battery is first put on charge, the voltage shoots up quickly. This behavior can be compared to lifting a weight with a rubber band, causing a lag. The capacity will eventually catch up when the battery is almost fully charged (Figure 3). This charge characteristic is typical of all batteries. The higher the charge current is, the larger the rubber-band effect will be. Cold temperatures or charging a cell with high internal resistance amplifies the effect.\nThe capacity trails the charge voltage like lifting a heavy weight with a rubber band.\nEstimating SoC by reading the voltage of a charging battery is impractical; measuring the open circuit voltage (OCV) after the battery has rested for a few hours is a better indicator. As with all batteries, temperature affects the OCV, so does the active material of Li-ion. SoC of smartphones, laptops and other devices is estimated by coulomb counting. (See BU-903: How to Measure State-of-charge)\nLi-ion cannot absorb overcharge. When fully charged, the charge current must be cut off. A continuous trickle charge would cause plating of metallic lithium and compromise safety. To minimize stress, keep the lithium-ion battery at the peak cut-off as short as possible.\nOnce the charge is terminated, the battery voltage begins to drop. This eases the voltage stress. Over time, the open circuit voltage will settle to between 3.70V and 3.90V/cell. Note that a Li-ion battery that has received a fully saturated charge will keep the voltage elevated for a longer than one that has not received a saturation charge.\nWhen lithium-ion batteries must be left in the charger for operational readiness, some chargers apply a brief topping charge to compensate for the small self-discharge the battery and its protective circuit consume. The charger may kick in when the open circuit voltage drops to 4.05V/cell and turn off again at 4.20V/cell. Chargers made for operational readiness, or standby mode, often let the battery voltage drop to 4.00V/cell and recharge to only 4.05V/cell instead of the full 4.20V/cell. This reduces voltage-related stress and prolongs battery life.\nSome portable devices sit in a charge cradle in the ON position. The current drawn through the device is called the parasitic load and can distort the charge cycle. Battery manufacturers advise against parasitic loads while charging because they induce mini-cycles. This cannot always be avoided and a laptop connected to the AC main is such a case. The battery might be charged to 4.20V/cell and then discharged by the device. The stress level on the battery is high because the cycles occur at the high-voltage threshold, often also at elevated temperature.\nA portable device should be turned off during charge. This allows the battery to reach the set voltage threshold and current saturation point unhindered. A parasitic load confuses the charger by depressing the battery voltage and preventing the current in the saturation stage to drop low enough by drawing a leakage current. A battery may be fully charged, but the prevailing conditions will prompt a continued charge, causing stress.\nWhile the traditional lithium-ion has a nominal cell voltage of 3.60V, Li-phosphate (LiFePO) makes an exception with a nominal cell voltage of 3.20V and charging to 3.65V. Relatively new is the Li-titanate (LTO) with a nominal cell voltage of 2.40V and charging to 2.85V. (See BU-205: Types of Lithium-ion)\nChargers for these non cobalt-blended Li-ions are not compatible with regular 3.60-volt Li-ion. Provision must be made to identify the systems and provide the correct voltage charging. A 3.60-volt lithium battery in a charger designed for Li-phosphate would not receive sufficient charge; a Li-phosphate in a regular charger would cause overcharge.\nLithium-ion operates safely within the designated operating voltages; however, the battery becomes unstable if inadvertently charged to a higher than specified voltage. Prolonged charging above 4.30V on a Li-ion designed for 4.20V/cell will plate metallic lithium on the anode. The cathode material becomes an oxidizing agent, loses stability and produces carbon dioxide (CO2). The cell pressure rises and if the charge is allowed to continue, the current interrupt device (CID) responsible for cell safety disconnects at 1,000–1,380kPa (145–200psi). Should the pressure rise further, the safety membrane on some Li-ion bursts open at about 3,450kPa (500psi) and the cell might eventually vent with flame. (See BU-304b: Making Lithium-ion Safe)\nVenting with flame is connected with elevated temperature. A fully charged battery has a lower thermal runaway temperature and will vent sooner than one that is partially charged. All lithium-based batteries are safer at a lower charge, and this is why authorities will mandate air shipment of Li-ion at 30 percent state-of-charge rather than at full charge. (See BU-704a: Shipping Lithium-based Batteries by Air)\nThe threshold for Li-cobalt at full charge is 130–150ºC (266–302ºF); nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) is 170–180ºC (338–356ºF) and Li-manganese is about 250ºC (482ºF). Li-phosphate enjoys similar and better temperature stabilities than manganese. (See also BU-304a: Safety Concerns with Li-ion and BU-304b: Making Lithium-ion Safe)\nLithium-ion is not the only battery that poses a safety hazard if overcharged. Lead- and nickel-based batteries are also known to melt down and cause fire if improperly handled. Properly designed charging equipment is paramount for all battery systems and temperature sensing is a reliable watchman.\nCharging lithium-ion batteries is simpler than nickel-based systems. The charge circuit is straight forward; voltage and current limitations are easier to accommodate than analyzing complex voltage signatures, which change as the battery ages. The charge process can be intermittent, and Li-ion does not need saturation as is the case with lead acid. This offers a major advantage for renewable energy storage such as a solar panel and wind turbine, which cannot always fully charge the battery. The absence of trickle charge further simplifies the charger. Equalizing charger, as is required with lead acid, is not necessary with Li-ion.\nConsumer and most industrial Li-ion chargers charge the battery fully. They do not offer adjustable end-of-charge voltages that would prolong the service life of Li-ion by lowering the end charge voltage and accepting a shorter runtime. Device manufacturers fear that such an option would complicate the charger. Exceptions are electric vehicles and satellites that avoid full charge to achieve long service life.\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

Great site folks.  Thanks.\nThis excellent article describes that dangerous overcharging is likely if we charge a 3.7V lithium ion cell at 4.2V and forget - in the constant voltage phase - to switch off charging after the current has dropped to one tenth of the initial value. But will this overcharging be a risk at *all* charging voltages all the way down to the minimum voltage that can move ions within the battery (around 3.4V, I guess). Put differently, is there a voltage between the minimum (3.4V?) and 4.2V at which it is safe to simply let the constant voltage phase run forever?\nIf such a lower safe voltage does not exist, how long would it take before charging at, say, 3.9V would start to cause trouble?

Your motorcycle alternator charging system made for lead acid batteries and cannot overcharge your new LiPo battery unless the bike was left running for 24-48 hours strait. Even then there is a float charge where the battery will stop charging at the highest point, this is installed on the alternator and is set for a 12v battery and cannot be changed, or in some cases the battery itself will have a float limit installed. In short, a LiPoFe battery can take more charge faster than a lead acid battery can, so any charging system that will charge lead acid, will be like a trickle charger for the LiPoFe battery and will not harm the LiPoFe battery at all. As long as the lithium battery and lead acid charger are both rated for 12V. \nA lithium battery charger will damage a lead acid battery by overcharging it with high voltage.

        "title": "BU-705a: Battery Recycling as a Business",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-705a-battery-recycling-as-a-business",
        "content": "Batteries are expensive and have a relatively short life span. As discarded batteries grow by the tonnage, entrepreneurs are enticed to start a business in recycling. With an annual world market (2015) of $33 billion, lead acid is the most common battery in use. This is followed by Li-ion at $16.6 billion, NiMH at $2 billion and NiCd at $1 billion. All other chemistries only make up $1 billion. Table 1 lists the material cost per ton to build these batteries.\nSubsidy needed\nSubsidy needed\nLithium-ion batteries are expensive to manufacture and this is in part due to the high material cost and complex preparation processes. The most expensive metal of most Li-ion is cobalt, a hard lustrous gray material that is also used to manufacture magnets and high-strength alloys.\nKnowing that billions of Li-ion batteries are discarded every year and given the high cost of lithium cobalt oxide, salvaging precious metals should make economic sense and one wonders why so few companies recycle these batteries.\nThe reason becomes clear when examining the complexity and low yield of recycling. The retrieved raw material barely pays for labor, which includes collection, transport, sorting into batteries chemistries, shredding, separation of metallic and non-metallic materials, neutralizing hazardous substances, smelting, and purification of the recovered metals.\nRecycling programs for lead acid are said to have started soon after Cadillac introduced the cranking motor in 1912 as a for-profit business rather than protecting the environment. Recycling can be harmful, especially with lead acid batteries. Lead can enter the body by inhaling or ingestion when touching the mouth with lead-contaminated hands. This puts workers and residents of the surrounding areas at risk of lead poisoning. (See BU-703: Health Concerns with Batteries)\nThe EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has imposed strict guidelines in recycling of lead acid batteries in the USA. The recycling plants must be sealed and the smokestacks fitted with scrubbers. To check for possible escape of lead particles, the plant perimeter must be surrounded with lead-monitoring devices. Rules are bound to be broken and batteries soon end up in Mexico and other developing countries with relaxed regulations. China, a leader in lead acid battery production, also took action to protect the environment by introducing strict guidelines that only reputable companies can meet.\nNickel-based batteries can also be recycled and the retrieved materials are iron and nickel, which are used in stainless steel production. Nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) yields the highest return in nickel, and with ample supply recycling is said to make money. Low demand for cadmium has reduced the profitability from recycling NiCd batteries. The growth in batteries is with Li-ion but valuable materials are difficult to retrieve. This makes Li-ion less attractive for recycling and a financial breakeven may not be possible without subsidies.\nThe true cost to manufacture Li-ion is not so much in the raw materials, as is the case with lead acid and NiMH, but in lengthy processing and purification processes of the raw materials to reach battery grade. Retrieving lithium at only 3 percent of the cell mix may never reach break-even levels. If the purity of lithium is below 99.5 percent, then it is not suitable as raw material for batteries. Recycling brings the metal to ground zero, from which costly preparations begin anew. It is often cheaper to mine raw material than to retrieve it from recycling. Lithium from recycled batteries is commonly used for non-battery applications, such as lubricating greases that are found in WD-40 and other products, rather than batteries. (See BU-308: Availability of Lithium)\nDirect recycling technologies for lithium-ion batteries my offer a solution in refining used Li-ion into high value cathode and anode materials. Direct recycling may become profitable if the technology can be developed to large-scale processing made possible with high volume EV batteries reaching end-of-life. Direct recycling is said to be cleaner than older methods that melt the material.\nAlthough alkaline and zinc-carbon account for over 90 percent of batteries consumed in the United States, they contain few precious metals and the toxicity is low. Organizations are seeking ways to recycle these batteries as well for the basic metal content and with high volume such a venture should become viable. Table 2 lists the typical metals content of commonly recycled batteries.\nEnvironmental issues and the ability to recycle play an important role when choosing a battery system. If the UPS operates mostly in standby and can provide longevity of 10 years, then lead acid is a strong contender. The preference of lead acid over Li-ion and nickel-based systems is manifested in moderate pricing, superior safety, dependable operation, and the ability to recycle. Table 3 compares the cost to manufacture and recycle batteries.\nThe primary objective of building a good battery is long life, safety and low price. Recycling is an afterthought and manufacturers do little to simplify the retrieving of precious metals. The recycling business is small compared to the vast battery industry, and to this day, only lead acid can be recycled profitably.\nNickel-based batteries might make money with good logistics, but Li-ion and most other chemistries yield too little in precious metals to make recycling a viable business without subsidies. The major expense with modern batteries is not so much the raw materials, as with lead acid, but lengthy preparations, purifications and processing down to micro- and nano-levels. Nevertheless, batteries contain valuable material that can be re-used for new products.\nTo make recycling feasible in the meantime, subsidies are created by adding a tax to each pack sold. The goal goes beyond retrieving metals for re-use to preventing toxic batteries from entering landfills. Combining the environmental benefit with making a profit is the ultimate goal, and this might become feasible with innovative new recycling processes in development.\nAnother model is to sort batteries into functional and non-functional groups and give those with capacities of 80 percent or more a second life. Cells and modules of larger battery systems can be tested individually and reassembled in a new pack(See BU-803: Can Batteries be Restored?)\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Charging a battery is simple but the complexity rises when a parasitic load is present during charge. Depending on battery chemistry, the charge process goes through several stages, and with lithium-ion Stage 1 consists of a constant current (CC) charge that brings the battery to roughly 70 percent state-of-charge (SoC). The cell reaches 4.20V/cell, a common voltage limit for Li-ion, after which Stage 2 continues by applying a constant voltage (CV) charge. The current begins to drop as the battery saturates. Full-charge is reached when the current decreases to typically 0.05C, which is one-twentieth of the rated ampere-hour. Li-ion cannot absorb overcharge and no charge is applied in Stage 3. Figure 1 illustrates typical voltage, current and capacity signatures of the CCCV charge.\nStage 1 applies bulk charge under constant current (CC).Stage 2 completes the charge under constant voltage (CV) as part of saturation charge.Stage 3 is the ready mode with no charge applied.Courtesy of Cadex\nThe CCCV method is also used to charge Lead acid with the difference that a float charge is applied in Stage 3 to keep the battery at full charge and to prevent sulfation. Nickel-based batteries receive trickle charge when fully charged to compensate for self-discharge. The Li-ion system is so efficient that excess energy has nowhere to go when the battery is fully charged. Turning the charge current off keeps the battery stable and enables the voltage to neutralize. A continuous float charge, also known as high-voltage-hold, increases the Li-ion battery to above the specified upper cut-offs potential. This would possibly produce gas; possibly cause a breakdown of cell components and probably shorten battery life and compromise safety.\nBattery usage can be categorized into three groups. The most basic is the Detachable Mode where the battery is charged outside the device unaffected by a parasitic load. Applications include mobile radios, power tools, drones and general instrumentations. This Detached Mode enables the most simplistic charge method because the battery is independent from a device. Most commercial charging chips are designed to operate in this mode.\nA growing usage pattern is the Contained Mode in which the battery is charged in the equipment. Smartphone, laptops and some medical devices are examples. The battery is charged in the device by connecting to the grid. The available AC power is divided into charging the battery and operating the device. When fully charged, the battery disconnects from the charger but may from time to time receive a topping charge. This typically occurs when the state-of-charge drops to 93 percent.\nThe third group is the Attached Mode where the battery is installed in a device. Typical applications are vehicles delivering hotel load and starting the engine. In the Attached Mode, the battery becomes part of an integrated system that is charged during the operation. Some medical, military and industrial devices also operate in Attached Mode providing vital functions. Table 2 summarizes battery usages in different charging environments.\nTable 2: Battery usage in different charging environments.\nParasitic loads add to charging complexity.\nThe presence of a continuous parasitic load on a battery complicates the charging process. It should be noted that most devices draw some parasitic load but the current is low and may consist of protection circuit for the Li-ion battery, memory back-up or running a clock. This does not distort the charge routine and can in most cases be ignored. However, the parasitic load in the Attached Mode can be high and distort the saturation signature in Stage 2. Such interference in the charging regime requires an alternate full-charge detection mechanism.\nPossible solutions are reducing the charge current in Stage 2 for some time, then turning the charge off and applying a topping charge when the state-of-charge drops to 93 percent. Another method is keeping the cell at the 4.20V/cell level. This would be the simplest technique but most Li-ion manufacturers do not approve of this method for safety and longevity reasons. A further option is lowering the charge from the customary 4.20V/cell to 4.10V/cell. This reduces capacity and cell manufacturers consider this viable but are not totally comfortable.\nScientists are studying the behavior of Li-ion at various high-voltage-holds as a function of electrolyte additives and choice of active materials. Unofficial findings show that cycling cells with extended hold times at 4.20V/cell does not lead to lithium plating with quality cells. However lower grade cells could develop high impedance, which can result in Li-plating when held at 4.20V/cell for an extended period of time at elevated temperatures of 40°C.\nKeeping Li-ion at high-voltage-hold is a sensitive issue. Few technical papers have been published that suggest how to correctly charge a battery with a parasitic load, nor do battery manufacturers share best practices. It is known that float charging at elevated temperature can cause a breakdown of cell components, which can potentially lead to an electrical short in the cell. Findings reveal that this defect does not necessarily relate to lithium plating that occurs when exceeding the charge voltage or when charging below freezing. Other harmful effects are at work that requires further examination.\nComponent breakdown can be reduced with electrolyte additives. Each battery manufacturer has its own secret sauce and is hesitant to publish the ingredients. As smoking and lack of exercise affects the health of each person differently, so also is no consistent information available when charging a specific Li-ion system with a parasitic load. There appears to be a lack of information on the effect of high-voltage-hold on Li-ion, especially when operating at elevated temperature and when fast-charging.\nLet’s look at lead acid, a system that shares similarities with Li-ion with charging but is more forgiving with overcharge. In Stage 1, lead acid charges to 2.40V/cell. Applying a fully saturated charge at Stage 2 is important to prevent sulfation. Instead of cutting the charge current to zero when ready, Stage 3 lowers the voltage from 2.40V/cell to 2.25V/cell to maintain full-charge. Keeping lead acid at the high 2.40V/cell would cause gassing and promote plate corrosion. Applying a voltage reduction is important especially in stationary applications where the battery is under continuous charge.\nThe charging system in a vehicle brings the battery to typically 14.40V (2.40V/cell) with no provision to lower the voltage when fully charged. Reducing the voltage to 13.50V (2.25V/cell) on a long road trip would be preferable but lead acid is forgiving and tolerates this condition by receiving rest when the vehicle is parked.\nStarter batteries are often replaced with LiFePO (Li-Phosphate) running on the same charging system. Four cells in series produce 12.80V, a similar voltage to six 2V lead acid cells in series. Each of the four Li-phosphate cell tops at 3.60V, which is the correct full-charge voltage. At this point, the charge should be disconnected but the topping charge of the vehicular charger continues while driving.\nLi-phosphate is tolerant to some overcharge; however, keeping the voltage at 14.40V for a prolonged time could stress the battery. Time will tell how durable Li-Phosphate will be when operating with a regular charging system programmed for lead acid. Li-phosphate batteries are also being installed in wheelchairs, scooters, golf cars and computers-on-wheels in hospitals. It is wise to assure charger compatibility when replacing lead acid with Li-phosphate.\nAn aircraft shares similarities with a vehicle in that both systems operate in the Attached Mode. As in a vehicle, the battery in an aircraft can be disconnected once the auxiliary generator provides power. An incident occurred when a nickel-cadmium (NiCd) battery overheated on a Boeing 777 in mid-flight. The circuit breaker was pulled without incident to separate the battery from the system.\nPilots demand that the battery be at full charge at all times. With NiCd, the common on-ship battery of passenger airplanes, this is no problem, but the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is equipped with Li-ion operating in Attached Mode. In 2013 this battery did indeed develop problems but experts say that the onboard battery fires were not caused by incorrect charging but by battery flaws. Whereas the failure rate of a quality Li-ion battery produced by major manufacturers is around 1 in 10 million, the early Boeing 787 batteries had a failure rate of 3 in 800.\nIn the early 1970s, the National Transportation Safety Board reported several battery incidents per year involving the then new NiCd, but none led to casualties. A redesign eventually made NiCd safe and similar improvements will also be made with Li-ion on board of an aircraft.\nOne big advantage of Li-ion apart from higher specific energy is their low maintenance. The Boeing engineers did, however, reach out to the automotive sector to learn how large Li-ion batteries are managed in electric vehicles. They discovered that an EV battery has some 50 sensing points for safety; the Boeing 787 had fewer than ten. This shortcoming has now been corrected.\nHow should a Li-ion battery be charged with a parasitic load? A solution is high-voltage-hold by applying a float charge in the Attached Mode, but this removes one level of safety redundancy, which concerns battery manufacturers. Should the float charge go out of control, the cell gets overcharged and lithium plating will occur. It is also known that high-voltage-hold at elevated temperature causes a breakdown of cell components. The long-term effects in practical use may not yet be fully understood.\nThe answer to safely operate Li-ion in the Attached Mode may lay in the choice of electrolyte additives as well as lowering the full charge state. The stress level of Li-ion is lowest between a state-of-charge of 30 and 80 percent. EVs use this preferred SoC bandwidth to achieve extraordinary long battery life, however the packs must be oversized to compensate for the reduced capacity.\nLi-ion is optimized for various applications that range from high-energy single cells for consumer products, to sturdy multi-cell configurations for medical, military and mobility use, and to high power cells for power tools. Operating Li-ion in the Attached Mode is a growing market and battery manufacturers will need to take note and deliver a product that will serve this new application.\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "title": "What Causes Car Batteries to Fail?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/what-causes-car-batteries-to-fail",
        "content": "Driving habits rather than battery defect are often the cause of battery failure.\nA German manufacturer of luxury cars reveals that of 400 car batteries returned under warranty, 200 are working well and have no problem. Low charge and acid stratification are the most common causes of the apparent failure. The car manufacturer says that the problem is more common on large luxury cars offering power-hungry auxiliary options than on the more basic models.In Japan, battery failure is the largest complaint among new car owners. The average car is only driven 13 km (8 miles) per day and mostly in a congested city. As a result, the batteries will never get fully charged and sulfation occurs. The batteries in Japanese cars are small and only provide enough power to crank the engine and perform some rudimentary functions. North America may be shielded from these battery problems, in part because of long distance driving. Good battery performance is important because problems during the warranty period tarnish customer satisfaction. Any service requirement during that time is recorded and the number is published in trade magazines. This data is of great interest among prospective car buyers throughout the world. Battery malfunction is seldom caused by a factory defect; driving habits are the more common culprits. Heavy accessory power when driving short distance prevents a periodic fully saturated charge that is so important for the longevity of a lead acid battery. According to a leading European manufacturer of car batteries, factory defects amounts to less than 7 percent.The battery remains a weak link and the breakdowns on 1.95 million vehicles six years or less are as follows:52% battery15% flat tire8% engine7% wheels7% fuel injection6% heating & cooling6% fuel systemA breakdown due to the battery remains the number one cause.* Source ADAC 2008 for the year 2007\nA common cause of battery failure is acid stratification. The electrolyte on a stratified battery concentrates on the bottom, causing the upper half of the cell to be acid poor. This effect is similar to a cup of coffee in which the sugar collects on the bottom when the waitress forgets to bring the stirring spoon. Batteries tend to stratify if kept at low charge (below 80%) and never have the opportunity to receive a full charge. Short distance driving while running windshield wiper and electric heaters contributes to this. Acid stratification reduces the overall performance of the battery.Figure 1 illustrates a normal battery in which the acid is equally distributed from top to bottom. This battery provides good performance because the correct acid concentration surrounds the plates. Figure 2 shows a stratified battery in which the acid concentration is light on top and heavy on the bottom. A light acid limits plate activation, promotes corrosion and reduces performance. High acid concentration on the bottom, on the other hand, artificially raises the open circuit voltage. The battery appears fully charged but provides a low CCA. High acid concentration also promotes sulfation and decreases the already low conductivity further. If unchecked, such a condition will eventually lead to battery failure.\nAllowing the battery to rest for a few days, applying a shaking motion or tipping the unit over tends to correct the problem. A topping charge by which the 12-volt battery is brought up to 16 volts for one to two hours also reverses the acid stratification. The topping charge also reduces sulfation caused by high acid concentration. Careful attention is needed to keep the battery from heating up and losing excessive electrolyte through hydrogen gassing. Always charge the battery in a well-ventilated room. Accumulation of hydrogen gas can lead to an explosion. Hydrogen is odorless and can only be detected with measuring devices.\nDuring the last 20 years, battery testing lagged behind other technologies. The reason: the battery is a very difficult animal to test, short of applying a full charge, discharge and recharge. The battery behaves similar to us humans. We still don't know why we perform better on certain days than others.Even by using highly accurate charge and discharge equipment, lead acid batteries produce disturbingly high capacity fluctuations on repetitive measurements. To demonstrate the variations, Cadex tested 91 car batteries with diverse performance levels (Figure 3). We first prepared the batteries by giving them a full charge and a 24-hour rest period. We then measured the capacity by applying a 25A discharge to 10.50V or 1.75V/cell (black diamonds).This procedure was repeated for a second time and the resulting capacities were plotted (purple squares). This produced a whoping +/-15% variation in capacity readings across the full population. Some batteries had higher readings the second time; others were lower. Other chemistries appear to be more consistent in capacity readings than lead acid.\nFrom the beginning, load testers have been the standard test method for car batteries. The year 1992 brought us AC conductance, a method that simplified battery testing. Now we are experimenting with multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a portable version at an affordable price.Getting a fast and dependable assessment of a failing battery is difficult. Most battery testers in use only take cold cranking amps (CCA) and voltage readings. Capacity, the most important measurement of a battery, is unavailable. While taking the CCA reading alone is relatively simple, measuring the capacity is very complex and instruments offering this feature are expensive. The Spectro CA-12 by Cadex Electronics is the first in a series of high-end battery testers capable of measuring capacity, CCA and state-of-charge (SoC) in a single, non-invasive test. The technology is based on multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The system injects 24 excitation frequencies ranging from 20 to 2000 Hertz. The sinusoidal signals are regulated at 10mV/cell to remain within the thermal battery voltage of lead acid. This achieves stable readings for small and large batteries. During the 30-second test, over 40 million transactions are completed. A patented algorithm analyses the data and the final results are displayed in capacity, CCA and state-of-charge.EIS is very complex and until recently required dedicated computers and expensive laboratory equipment, not to mention chemists and engineers to interpret the readings. The hardware of a full EIS system is commonly mounted on racks and the installation runs into tens of thousands of dollars.\nNo battery tester solves all problems. Entry-level testers are low cost, simple to use and capable of servicing a broad range of batteries. However, these units only provide a rough indication of the battery condition. A lab test at Cadex demonstrates that a battery tester based on EIS is four times more accurate in detecting weak batteries than AC conductance. Conventional testers often misjudge the battery on account of low state-of-charge. Many batteries are replaced when they should have been recharged, while others are given a clean bill of health when it should have been replaced.Acid stratification is difficult to measure, even with the EIS technology. Non-invasive testers simply take a snapshot, average the measurements and spit out the results. Stratified batteries tend to show higher state-of-charge readings because of elevated voltage. On preliminary tests, the Spectro CA-12 also shows slightly higher CCA and capacity readings than normal. After letting the battery rest, the capacity tends to normalize. This may be due to diffusion effects in the stratified as a result of resting. Little information is available on how long a stratified battery needs to rest to improve the condition, other than to note that higher temperatures will hasten the diffusion process.Ideally, a battery tester should indicate the level of acid stratification; sulfation, surface charge and other such condition and display how to correct the problem. This feature is not yet possible. Much research is being done in finding a solution that offers a more complete battery evaluation without the need for a full discharge. The knowledge gained on lead acid batteries can then be applied to other battery systems, such as traction, military, marine, aviation and stationary batteries.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "NOTE: This article has been archived. Please read our new \"New Lead Acid Systems\" for an updated version.\nLead acid batteries continue to hold a leading position, especially in wheeled mobility and stationary applications. This strong market appeal entices manufacturers to explore ways to make the batteries better. Improvements have been made and some claims are so promising that one questions the trustworthiness. It is no secret that researchers prefer publishing the positive attributes while keeping the negatives under wraps. The following information on lead acid developments was obtained from available printed resources at the time of writing.\nThe composite plate material of the Firefly Energy battery is based on a lead-acid variant that is lighter, longer living, and has higher active material utilization than current lead acid systems. It is also one of the few lead-acid batteries that can operate for extended time in partial-states-of-charge. The battery includes carbon-foam electrodes for the negative plates, which gives it a performance that is comparable to NiMH but at lower manufacturing costs. Firefly Energy was a spin-off of Caterpillar and in 2010 went into bankruptcy. The company was revived under separate ownership. Today, Firefly International Energy manufactures the Oasis line of batteries in limited quantities in the US.\nSimilar to the Firefly Energy battery, the Altraverda battery is based on lead. It uses a proprietary titanium sub-oxide ceramic structure, called Ebonex®, for the grid and an AGM separator. The un-pasted plate contains Ebonex® particles in a polymer matrix that holds a thin lead alloy foil on the external surfaces. With 50–60Wh/kg, the specific energy is about one-third larger than regular lead acid and is comparable with NiCd. Based in the UK, Altraverda works with East Penn in the USA, and the battery is well suited for higher voltage applications.\nThe Axion Power e3 Supercell is a hybrid battery/ultracapacitor in which the positive electrode consists of standard lead dioxide and the negative electrode is activated carbon, while maintaining an assembly process that is similar to lead acid. The Axion Power battery offers faster recharge times and longer cycle life on repeated deep discharges than what is possible with regular lead acid systems. This opens the door for the start-stop application in micro-hybrid cars. The lead-carbon combination of the Axion Power battery lowers the lead content on the negative plate, which results in a weight reduction of 30 percent compared to a regular lead acid. This, however, also lowers the specific energy to 15–25Wh/kg instead of 30–50Wh/kg, which a regular lead acid battery normally provides.\nThe CSIRO Ultrabattery combines an asymmetric ultracapacitor and a lead acid battery in each cell. The capacitor enhances the power and lifetime of the battery by acting as a buffer during charging and discharging, prolonging the lifetime by a factor of four over customary lead acid systems and producing 50 percent more power. The manufacturer also claims that the battery is 70 percent cheaper to produce than current hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) batteries. CSIRO batteries are undergoing road trials in a Honda Insight HEV and show good results. Furukawa Battery in Japan licensed the technology. The CSIRO battery is also being tested for start-stop applications in micro-hybrid cars to replace the lead acid starter battery. This battery promises extended life when exposed to frequent start-stop conditions and is able to take a fast charge.\nThis is the mystery battery/ultracapacitor combination that receives much media attention. The battery is based on a modified barium titanate ceramic powder and claims a specific energy of up to 280Wh/kg, higher than lithium-ion. The company is very secretive about their invention and releases only limited information. Some of their astonishing claims are: One-tenth of the weight of a NiMH battery in a hybrid application, no deep-cycle wear-down, three- to six-minute charge time, no hazardous material, similar manufacturing costs to lead acid, and a self-discharge that is only 0.02 percent per month, a fraction of that of lead acid and Li-ion.\nSource: ESTOR\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-908-battery-management-system-bms",
        "content": "Mercedes CEO Dieter Zetsche says, \"The intelligence of the battery does not lie in the cell but in the complex battery system.\" This is reminiscent to computers in the 1970s that had big hardware but little software [1]\nThe purpose of a BMS is to:\nNot all BMS offer all these features. The most basic functions are battery protection and showing state-of-charge (SoC).\nWhile SoC is helpful, the readout is incomplete without also tracking the capacity as the battery fades. The user may be accustomed to a battery that delivers full capacity, but this condition is temporary and cannot be maintained. Capacity is the primary indicator of battery state-of-health (SoH) and should be part of the battery management system (BMS). Knowing SoC and SoH provides state-of-function (SoF), the ultimate confidence of readiness, but technology to provide this information in an effective way is being improved.\nBuilding a better BMS is a challenge when considering that we still lack a dependable method to read state-of-charge, the most basic measure of a battery(See BU-903: How to Measure State-of-charge) Reading the remaining energy in a battery is more complex than dispensing liquid fuel. While a fuel tank has a fixed dimension and delivers fuel which can be measured with great accuracy, an electrochemical storage system reduces its size and the in- and out-flowing coulombs cannot be assessed with great accuracy as the battery ages.\nThe BMS also provides protection when charging and discharging; it disconnects the battery if set limits are exceeded or if a failure occurs. Established BMS standards are the SMBus (System Management Bus) used for mostly portable applications, as well as the CAN Bus (Controller Area Network) and the simpler LIN Bus (Local Interconnect Network) for automotive use.\nStationary batteries were among the first to include supervisory systems and the most basic is voltage monitoring of individual cells. Some systems also include cell temperature and current measurement. Recording a slight difference in cell temperature hints to a problem, and measuring the voltage drop of each cell at a given load reveals cell resistance. Dry-out, corrosion, plate separation, and other malfunctions can thus be identified.\nAlthough the BMS is effective in detecting anomalies; capacity fade, the most predictable health indicator, is difficult to estimate because voltage and internal resistance are commonly not affected. The ability to read capacity fade from 100 to 70 percent would be valuable, but most BMS cannot do this effectively and the battery might be given a clean bill of health even if the capacity has dropped to 50 percent. Most BMS only respond to anomalies that lie outside capacity estimation, such as voltage differences among cells caused by cell imbalances and a change in internal resistance.\nSome industrial and medical device manufacturers use a date stamp to determine the end of battery life, others observe the cycle count. While counting cycles may be simplistic, no convention exists that defines a cycle and some systems simply call it a cycle when the battery is charged(See BU-501: Basics About Discharging) Date-stamping has similar shortcomings in that it promotes premature replacement of batteries that are seldom used, while the heavy hitters may stay in service too long(See BU-803: Can Batteries be Restored?) To reduce risk of failure, authorities mandate early replacement, and a two-year service life is common. Prolonged storage will give the batteries a very short working life.\nBiomedical engineers are aware that most batteries are replaced too soon. iPhone owners have complained that their smartphones show 100 percent charge when the battery is only 90 percent charged. Even military leaders say that their battery arsenal for combat is so poor that many soldiers carry rocks instead of batteries. Effective battery management is either missing or is inadequate. Over-expectations with BMS are common and the user is stunned when stranded without battery power.\nLet’s look at how a BMS works, note the shortcomings and examine up-and-coming technologies that could change the way batteries are monitored.\nA BMS takes the imprint of the “chemical battery” during charging and discharge and establishes the “digital battery” that communicates with the user. Figure 1 illustrates the battery components consisting of stored energy, the empty portion that can be refilled and the inactive part that is permanently lost. Rated capacity refers to the manufacturer’s specified capacity in Ah (ampere-hours) that is only valid when the battery is new; available capacity designates the true energy storage capability derived by deducting the inactive part. State-of-charge (SoC) refers to the stored energy, which also includes the inactive part.\nA battery consists of stored energy, the empty portion that can be recharged and the inactive portion that is permanently lost due to aging.\nA BMS is programmed to a rated capacity and it measures the in-and-outflowing coulombs that relate to the available capacity. As the capacity drops, the coulomb count decreases and this discrepancy enables capacity estimation. The most accurate readings are possible when counting the coulombs from a fully discharged battery during a complete charge or discharging a fully charged battery to the cut-off point. Such clean starts are seldom possible and real-life capacity estimations get muddled over time.\nA BMS sets flags when receiving a full discharge and charge. During a rest period, an advanced BMS may also calculate SoC on hand of the stable open circuit voltage and begin counting the coulombs during charge and discharge from that vantage point. Some BMS also look at voltage recovery after removing a load to estimate SoC and/or SoH.\nThe old Volkswagen Beetle had minimal battery problems. Its battery management system applied charge to the battery and burned the over-charge energy on a resistor while cruising through a relay-operated regulator. The car had no parasitic loads when parked.\nSince then, modern vehicles have been inundated with onboard electronics to enhance safety, convenience, comfort and pleasure; features no one knew were needed. For the accessories to function reliably, the state-of-charge of the battery must be known at all times. This is especially critical with start-stop technology that is being adopted worldwide.\nWhen the engine of a start-stop car is off at a red light, the battery draws 25–50 amperes to feed the lights, ventilators, windshield wipers and other accessories. The battery must have enough charge to crank the engine, which requires an additional 350A for a brief moment. When the engine runs again and the car accelerates to the posted speed limit, the battery only begins charging after a 10-second delay, a deferral allows channeling all energy to vehicle acceleration. When back in charge mode, the lead acid battery is notoriously slow in charging.\nTo provide vital battery information, luxury cars are fitted with a battery sensor that measure voltage, current and temperature. Figure 2 illustrates the electronic battery monitor (EBM) packaged in a small housing forming part of the positive battery clamp.\nThe sensor reads voltage, current and temperature to estimate state-of-charge and detect anomalies; capacity assessment is not possible.\nThe EBM works well when the battery is new but most sensors do not adjust correctly to aging. The SoC accuracy of a new battery is about +/–10 percent. With aging, the EBM begins to drift and the accuracy can drop to 20 percent and higher. This is in part connected to capacity fade, a value most BMS cannot estimate effectively. It is not an oversight by engineers; they fully understand the complexities and shortcomings involved.\nA typical start-stop vehicle goes through about 2,000 micro cycles per year. Such a strain would reduce the capacity of a standard starter battery to about 60 percent and carmakers use different battery systems that include AGM and the Advanced Lead-carbon(Also see BU-806a: How Heat and Loading affect Battery Life)\nAutomakers want to ensure that no driver gets stranded in traffic with a dead battery. To conserve energy, modern cars turn off unnecessary accessories when the battery is low on charge and the motor stays on at a stoplight. Even with this measure, the state-of-charge can remain low if commuting in gridlock traffic because an idling motor does not provide much charge to the battery. With lights, windshield wipers and electric heating elements engaged there could be a net discharge.\nBattery monitoring is also important on hybrid vehicles to optimize charge levels. Intelligent charge management prevents overcharge and avoids deep discharge. When the charge level is low, the internal combustion engine (ICE) engages earlier than normal and is left running longer for additional charge. On a fully charged battery the ICE turns off and the car moves on electric energy in slow traffic.\nAn EV driver expects similar accuracies in energy reserve as is possible with a fuel-powered vehicle but current technology does not allow this. To compensate, the EV battery is overrated and the fuel gauge is adjusted to preserve extra energy when the charge drops low to cover for inaccuracies. The EV driver is advised not to let the charge go too low but to charge more often. A mid-charger range is best for the battery.\nThe EV driver also anticipates the same driving range as the car ages. This is not possible and the drivable distance gets shorter with each passing year, but the BMS makes allowances. A new battery may only charge to about 80 percent and discharge to 30 percent. As the capacity fades, the bandwidth gradually increases, providing similar driving ranges as a new battery would. The distances traveled will be noticeably shorter when driving in cold temperatures because of reduced battery performance and once the battery has aged beyond the energy compensation band of the BMS(See BU-1003: Electric Vehicle)\nThe EBM has limitations in that it cannot estimate capacity effectively. This can be overcome by adding capacity estimations(See BU-904: How to Measure Capacity) Figure 3 shows a BMS with common sensing points to which the ability to measure capacity has been added. Spectro™ stands for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with complex modeling. This converts a simple battery sensor to the state-of-function (SoF) level.\nKnowing SoF improves battery validation, but some device manufacturers refuse to reveal capacity readings to a consumer that are less than 100 percent, especially during the warranty period. To conceal unwanted information, the data can be made code-accessible for service personnel use only(See also BU-602: How does a Battery Fuel Gauge Work?)\nConsumer concerns put aside, SoF signifies a momentous improvement to BMS in terms of battery reliability as it tracks capacity fade and calculates the true runtime on the available energy. Capacity-based BMS will also predict eventual replacement, an issue that cannot be fully satisfied with current BMS technologies. Future BMS will combine the information of the “digital battery” with that of the “chemical battery” to provide reliable SoF data through advanced learn algorithms.\n[1] Source: CleanTechnica\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Lithium-ion Safety Concerns",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/lithium-ion-safety-concerns",
        "content": "When Sony introduced the first lithium-ion battery in 1991, they knew of the potential safety risks. A recall of the previously released rechargeable metallic lithium battery was a bleak reminder of the discipline one must exercise when dealing with this high energy-dense battery system. Pioneering work for the lithium battery began in 1912, but is was not until the early 1970's when the first non-rechargeable lithium batteries became commercially available. Attempts to develop rechargeable lithium batteries followed in the eighties. These early models were based on metallic lithium and offered very high energy density. However, inherent instabilities of lithium metal, especially during charging, put a damper on the development. The cell had the potential of a thermal run-away. The temperature would quickly rise to the melting point of the metallic lithium and cause a violent reaction. A large quantity of rechargeable lithium batteries had to be recalled in 1991 after the pack in a cellular phone released hot gases and inflicted burns to a man's face. Because of the inherent instability of lithium metal, research shifted to a non-metallic lithium battery using lithium ions. Although slightly lower in energy density, the lithium-ion system is safe, providing certain precautions are met when charging and discharging. Today, lithium-ion is one of the most successful and safe battery chemistries available. Two billion cells are produced every year. Lithium-ion cells with cobalt cathodes hold twice the energy of a nickel-based battery and four-times that of lead acid. Lithium-ion is a low maintenance system, an advantage that most other chemistries cannot claim. There is no memory and the battery does not require scheduled cycling to prolong its life. Nor does lithium-ion have the sulfation problem of lead acid that occurs when the battery is stored without periodic topping charge. Lithium-ion has a low self-discharge and is environmentally friendly. Disposal causes minimal harm.Long battery runtimes have always been the wish of many consumers. Battery manufacturers responded by packing more active material into a cell and making the electrodes and separator thinner. This enabled a doubling of energy density since lithium-ion was introduced in 1991. The high energy density comes at a price. Manufacturing methods become more critical the denser the cells become. With a separator thickness of only 20-25µm, any small intrusion of metallic dust particles can have devastating consequences. Appropriate measures will be needed to achieve the mandated safety standard set forth by UL 1642. Whereas a nail penetration test could be tolerated on the older 18650 cell with a capacity of 1.35Ah, today's high-density 2.4Ah cell would become a bomb when performing the same test. UL 1642 does not require nail penetration. Lithium-ion batteries are nearing their theoretical energy density limit and battery manufacturers are beginning to focus on improving manufacturing methods and increasing safety.\nWith the high usage of lithium-ion in cell phones, digital cameras and laptops, there are bound to be issues. A one-in-200,000 failure rate triggered a recall of almost six million lithium-ion packs used in laptops manufactured by Dell and Apple. Heat related battery failures are taken very seriously and manufacturers chose a conservative approach. The decision to replace the batteries puts the consumer at ease and lawyers at bay. Let's now take a look at what's behind the recall.Sony Energy Devices (Sony), the maker of the lithium-ion cells in question, says that on rare occasions microscopic metal particles may come into contact with other parts of the battery cell, leading to a short circuit within the cell. Although battery manufacturers strive to minimize the presence of metallic particles, complex assembly techniques make the elimination of all metallic dust nearly impossible.\nA mild short will only cause an elevated self-discharge. Little heat is generated because the discharging energy is very low. If, however, enough microscopic metal particles converge on one spot, a major electrical short can develop and a sizable current will flow between the positive and negative plates. This causes the temperature to rise, leading to a thermal runaway, also referred to 'venting with flame.' Lithium-ion cells with cobalt cathodes (same as the recalled laptop batteries) should never rise above 130°C (265°F). At 150°C (302°F) the cell becomes thermally unstable, a condition that can lead to a thermal runaway in which flaming gases are vented.During a thermal runaway, the high heat of the failing cell can propagate to the next cell, causing it to become thermally unstable as well. In some cases, a chain reaction occurs in which each cell disintegrates at its own timetable. A pack can get destroyed within a few short seconds or linger on for several hours as each cell is consumed one-by-one. To increase safety, packs are fitted with dividers to protect the failing cell from spreading to neighboring cells.\nThere are two basic types of lithium-ion chemistries: cobalt and manganese (spinel). To achieve maximum runtime, cell phones, digital cameras and laptops use cobalt-based lithium-ion. Manganese is the newer of the two chemistries and offers superior thermal stability. It can sustain temperatures of up to 250°C (482°F) before becoming unstable. In addition, manganese has a very low internal resistance and can deliver high current on demand. Increasingly, these batteries are used for power tools and medical devices. Hybrid and electric vehicles will be next.The drawback of spinel is lower energy density. Typically, a cell made of a pure manganese cathode provides only about half the capacity of cobalt. Cell phone and laptop users would not be happy if their batteries quit halfway through the expected runtime. To find a workable compromise between high energy density, operational safety and good current delivery, manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries can mix the metals. Typical cathode materials are cobalt, nickel, manganese and iron phosphate. Let me assure the reader that lithium-ion batteries are safe and heat related failures are rare. The battery manufacturers achieve this high reliability by adding three layers of protection. They are: [1] limiting the amount of active material to achieve a workable equilibrium of energy density and safety; [2] inclusion of various safety mechanisms within the cell; and [3] the addition of an electronic protection circuit in the battery pack.These protection devices work in the following ways: The PTC device built into the cell acts as a protection to inhibit high current surges; the circuit interrupt device (CID) opens the electrical path if an excessively high charge voltage raises the internal cell pressure to 10 Bar (150 psi); and the safety vent allows a controlled release of gas in the event of a rapid increase in cell pressure. In addition to the mechanical safeguards, the electronic protection circuit external to the cells opens a solid-state switch if the charge voltage of any cell reaches 4.30V. A fuse cuts the current flow if the skin temperature of the cell approaches 90°C (194°F). To prevent the battery from over-discharging, the control circuit cuts off the current path at about 2.50V/cell. In some applications, the higher inherent safety of the spinel system permits the exclusion of the electric circuit. In such a case, the battery relies wholly on the protection devices that are built into the cell.We need to keep in mind that these safety precautions are only effective if the mode of operation comes from the outside, such as with an electrical short or a faulty charger. Under normal circumstances, a lithium-ion battery will simply power down when a short circuit occurs. If, however, a defect is inherent to the electrochemical cell, such as in contamination caused by microscopic metal particles, this anomaly will go undetected. Nor can the safety circuit stop the disintegration once the cell is in thermal runaway mode. Nothing can stop it once triggered.\nA major concern arises if static electricity or a faulty charger has destroyed the battery's protection circuit. Such damage can permanently fuse the solid-state switches in an ON position without the user knowing. A battery with a faulty protection circuit may function normally but does not provide protection against abuse. Another safety issue is cold temperature charging. Consumer grade lithium-ion batteries cannot be charged below 0°C (32°F). Although the packs appear to be charging normally, plating of metallic lithium occurs on the anode while on a sub-freezing charge. The plating is permanent and cannot be removed. If done repeatedly, such damage can compromise the safety of the pack. The battery will become more vulnerable to failure if subjected to impact, crush or high rate charging. Asia produces many non-brand replacement batteries that are popular with cell phone users because of low price. Many of these batteries don't provide the same high safety standard as the main brand equivalent. A wise shopper spends a little more and replaces the battery with an approved model. Figure 1 shows a cell phone that was destroyed while charging in a car. The owner believes that a no-name pack caused the destruction.\nFigure 2: A cell phone with a no-brand battery that vented with flame while charging in the back of a car.To prevent the infiltration of unsafe packs on the market, most manufacturers sell lithium-ion cells only to approved battery pack assemblers. The inclusion of an approved safety circuit is part of the purchasing requirement. This makes it difficult for a hobbyist to purchase single lithium-ion cells off-the-shelf in a store. The hobbyist will have no other choice than to revert to nickel-based batteries. I would caution against using an unidentified lithium-ion battery from an Asian source, if such cells is available.The safety precaution is especially critical on larger batteries, such as laptop packs. The hazard is so much greater than on a small cell phone battery if something goes wrong. For this reason, many laptop manufacturers secure their batteries with a secret code that only the matching computer can access. This prevents non-brand-name batteries from flooding the market. The drawback is a higher price for the replacement battery. Readers of www.BatteryUniversity.com often ask me for a source of cheap laptop batteries. I have to disappoint the shoppers by directing them to the original vendor for a brand name pack.Considering the number of lithium-ion batteries used on the market, this energy storage system has caused little harm in terms of damage and personal injury. In spite of the good record, its safety is a hot topic that gets high media attention, even on a minor mishap. This caution is good for the consumer because we will be assured that this popular energy storage device is safe. After the recall of Dell and Apple laptop batteries, cell manufacturers will not only try packing more energy into the pack but will attempt to make it more bulletproof.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

We like to hear from you but we cannot answer all inquiries. We recommend posting your question in the comment sections for the Battery University Group (BUG) to share.\nAs is usually the answer, it depends.  18650 cells can be over-discharged and over-charged if your discharging device or charger is expecting something other than the specific battery chemistry you're actually using.  Make sure your battery has a lower-voltage cutoff (it probably doesn't) and make sure you're using a charger that knows what the upper voltage cutoff should be for the particular 18650 you're using.  The battery datasheet will tell you the maximum cutoff voltage.  It will be different for LiFePO4 vs NMC/NCA vs Li-Ion (Lithium Cobalt).  If you over-discharge, you need to dispose of that cell properly.  Plating on the anode is no joke.\nIt is quite apparent now that the world is leaning heavily towards the use of battery powered everything. The problem with that is the creators and engineers of these electric cars for example live in warm climates and so also do their tests there. We live in Canada and the temperatures are always below 0 Celcius in winter, more like -40 Celcius to be exact. How would you charge a battery as such and maintain the charge in rural areas that dont have charging stations at every block? Also do the recent fires and explosions of cars and buses change this study above in terms of battery safety? The danger doesnt seem so rare anymore.\nCharging battery for first time, should I be able to hear battery charging\nI just wanted to know is it o.k using non protected 18650 battery's in flash lights, they use only one.\nlumens is 900.  and what are the chances of thermal run away? battery's are new\nI did learned a lot on here, like inspecting battery cases and such. thanks\nComments from the previous website are not compatible with our new commenting system but we have preserved them so our users can still reference and make use the information in them.\nThe material on Battery University is based on the indispensable new 4th edition of \"Batteries in a Portable World - A Handbook on Rechargeable Batteries for Non-Engineers\" which is available for order through Amazon.com.\nBuy On Amazon"

        "title": "The Cost of Portable Power",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/the-cost-of-portable-power",
        "content": "NOTE: This article has been archived. Please read our new \"Cost of Power\" for an updated version.\nElectrical energy from non-rechargeable (primary) batteries is expensive in relative terms and its use is limited to low power applications such as watches, flashlights and portable entertainment devices. Cell phones, laptops and power tools run mainly on rechargeable (secondary) batteries.In this paper we calculate the cost to produce 1000 watts of power for one hour (1kWh) from different energy storage medias. We first look at primary and secondary batteries; then compare the energy cost derived from an internal combustion motor, the fuel cell and finally the electrical grid.\nFigure 1 reveals the cost of energy using commercial alkaline cells. The right column shows a lithium battery for still cameras and memory backup. It can be seen that larger cells provide a lower cost per kWh than small cells. The energy cost from the AA is more than half that of the smaller AAA. The C cell provides the lowest cost per kWh. The D cell has gone up in cost because of moderate use. Advanced systems, such as lithium, provide very high energy density at a premium cost. The energy cost of the 6-volt camera battery is more than ten times that of an alkaline C cell.\nPrimary batteries hold more energy than secondary batteries per size and weight. Operational readiness, long storage and instant readiness are other benefits. Primary batteries contain little toxic substances and are considered environmentally friendly.\nSecondary batteries provide far more economical energy than primaries, as Figure 2 reveals. This analysis is based on the estimated purchase price of a commercial battery pack and on the number of discharge-charge cycles it can endure before replacement is necessary. The calculated cost does not include the electricity needed for charging, nor does it account for the purchasing cost of the charging equipment.\nNewer chemistries provide higher energy densities than conventional batteries per size and weight but the cost per kWh is higher. This cost is, to a large extent, governed by the number of charge/discharge cycles the battery can endure. The low costs of nickel-cadmium can only be achieved by applying a full discharge once every 1-2 month as part of a maintenance program to prevent memory. If omitted, nickel-cadmium is on par with nickel-metal-hydride and lithium-ion in terms of cycle life. Lack of maintenance would increase the cost three-fold. Environmental conditions, such as elevated temperatures and incorrect charging, reduce the expected battery life of all battery chemistries. The calculated cycle life is based on best cases.By far the lowest cost per kWh is lead-acid for wheelchairs and scooters. Running a laptop off a large lead-acid battery would reduce the energy cost twenty fold. This, however, would be a hard sell.\nFigure 3 compares the energy cost to generate 1kW of energy from the primary AA alkaline cells, a nickel-cadmium pack, a combustion engine used in a midsize car, fuel cells and the electrical grid. The cost estimation takes into account the initial investment, fuel costs where applicable and eventual replacement of the systems.\nThe fuel cell offers the most effective means of generating electricity but is expensive in terms of cost per kWh. Fuel cells, as a battery replacement, will only become economically viable once such units are available in compact design at a reasonable price. Fuel cells for stationary applications are still more expensive than diesel. The least viable application in terms of cost is fuel cells for vehicles. The internal combustion motor, as we know it today, is hard to beat. According to the US Department of Energy, hydrogen is four times as expensive as gasoline and the fuel cell is ten times as expensive to build as a gasoline engine. Incentives other than cost may be needed to entice motorists to switch to the environmentally friendly fuel cell.The lowest cost per kWh is electricity from the grid. The energy can be generated in remote locations. The transportation maintenance and costs are relatively low. All costing information is based on current estimates and assumptions.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Predictive Test Methods for Starter Batteries",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/predictive-test-methods-for-starter-batteries",
        "content": "Starter batteries have two end-of-life modes: Heat failure and capacity fade. Heat failure is caused by corrosion that appears early in life and manifests itself in poor cranking caused by high internal resistance. This deficiency can easily be measured with a CCA tester. A skilled mechanic can also estimate CCA performance by cranking response.\nCapacity is more difficult to estimate and specifies the energy a battery holds. While CCA tends to stay high during the life of a battery, capacity fades gradually without the user noticing until the vehicle won’t start one day for lack of capacity. An analogy is a bridge that holds up well and then suddenly collapses with little warning.\nFigure 1: Cables supporting the Morandi bridge in Italy had lost 20% in strength. The capacity of most starter batteries can drop 75% before cranking stops. Capacity does not correlate well with CCA.New batteries are overrated to allow for performance drop; 25–30% is the low-end capacity cutoff of a starter battery. Motorists also get stranded when cold temperatures lower the already low capacity further. Most service garages replace the battery when dropping to a capacity of 40%.\nBattery life has decreased from the typically 5 year to 4 years in new cars even though the battery is said to have improved. Auxiliary loads such as heating elements, mechanical gates and start-stop function lowers the longevity because strenuous loading hastens capacity fade. In most cases capacity governs the end of battery life. This hints to the importance of capacity checking, but the measurement is difficult to attain. Measuring CCA alone is insufficient as CCA and capacity do not correlate well.Each battery system manifests capacity loss differently. Lead acid loses active material, also known as softening or shedding. A deep-cycle battery contains thick plates to endure repeat cycling, but the starter battery has thin, sponge-like plates to provide a large surface area and achieve high cranking power but the cycle life is limited to 12–15 full cycles. A third variety is the standby battery built for longevity that is filled with low-gravity electrolyte to reduce corrosion. The resulting lower specific energy and resulting larger size is less critical with stationary than mobile batteries. Since UPS batteries are seldom cycled, the plates have a moderate thickness.Acid stratification is another battery failure in starter batteries that is caused by a fixed regime of charging and partially discharging. Charged electrolyte is heavier than water and gravitates to the bottom. High concentration hastens plate corrosion from the bottom up as illustrated in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: Effect of acid stratification in a starter battery.The heavier acid gravitates to the bottom and the lighter to the top, affecting plate corrosion from the bottom up.Source: iQ Power\nAnother commons cause of battery failure is sulfation. This occurs when the lead acid battery dwells in a partially charged state and seldom receives a full charge. Batteries in cars driven in city traffic with accessories engaged typically suffer from sulfation because of under-charge. A motor in idle or at low driving speed may not charge the battery sufficiently.\nIf serviced in time, sulfation can be reversed by applying a slow charge with a regulated current of about 2 amps for 72 hours. Once the sulfate crystals turn into large crystalline structures, restoration is no longer possible. These large crystals are said to block the electrolyte from entering the pores of the plates, rendering the battery unserviceable.Rapid battery testing does not involve “measuring” a condition but evaluating symptoms that change with state-of-charge (SoC) and temperature. Agitation after loading and charging and prolonged idle times also alters these symptoms. The challenge is distinguishing a good battery with low charge from a poor battery with full charge. The performance of both batteries is similar but the condition differs.Figure 3 compares CCA and capacity of a battery that suffered heat damage. The capacity is still high but the energy cannot be delivered because high resistance prevents power delivery.\nFigure 3: Heat failed battery.Battery fails in 1-2 years due to corrosion, mechanical defect or sulfation.Symptoms: Poor cranking due to high internal resistance. Failure mode is not sudden but progressive.Test Method: AC conductance tester or equivalent. Shows low CCA reading.\nFigure 4 demonstrates an aged pack with capacity fade. CCA may still be good but the battery lacks sufficient energy to crank the engine.\nFigure 4. Full 4–5 year life.Battery fails due to capacity fade. CCA remains within the workable range.Symptoms: Failure mode is sudden as capacity fade goes unnoticed. Capacity should be checked as part of preventative service.Test Method: Spectro™\nFigure 5 demonstrates CCA and capacity fade as a function of aging. In the lengthy test, a German luxury car maker examines 175 starter batteries to evaluate CCA and capacity behavior. Batteries in the green “pass” field are well within specifications but those in the narrow amber “fringe” field are of interest because they still crank well and are subject to failure because of low capacity. The batteries in the red “fail” area no longer function due to low capacity or other defects. Very few batteries examined failed due to low CCA; most go through the capacity line.\nFigure 5: Capacity and CCA of 175 starter batteries.\nMost batteries pass through the Capacity Line; few fail because of low CCA. The test batteries were trunk mounted and driven in a moderate climate.Note: Test was conducted by a German luxury car manufacturer.Capacity and CCA were done according to DIN and IEC standards. Heat damaged batteries were eliminated prior.\nTesting a battery resembles a medical doctor examining a patient. A serious illness could go unnoticed if only blood pressure or temperature were taken. A false assessment would also occur with a battery if only voltage and internal resistance readings were taken. While medical staff is well trained to evaluate tests taken, battery analysis does not receive the same care, nor have test devices advanced to the same level as medical instruments.\nAn example of advancements in medical devices is the x-ray. Wilhelm Röntgen invented the machine in 1895 to check broken bones. Healthcare meanwhile progressed to CAT scan and MRI to also reveal soft tissues.\nFigure 6: Broken bone as seen with an x-ray machine. Modern CAT and MRI machines also reflect soft tissues.\nSimilar advancements are being made in battery testing. Cadex Electronics has been pioneering with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to check the state-of-health of lead acid batteries non-invasively with frequency scanning. EIS also evaluates the condition of lithium-ion batteries.Research laboratories have been using EIS for many years to evaluate battery characteristics but high equipment cost, slow test times and the need for trained personnel to decipher large volume of data has limited this technology to laboratories. Battery scientists predict that future battery diagnostics will be based on EIS technologies.The battery rapid-tester based on EIS developed by Cadex is ruggedized to serve on the garage floor. Based on multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, also known as Spectro™, the device injects sinusoidal signals into the battery at a few millivolts. After digital filtering, the extracted signal forms a Nyquist plot onto which various electro-chemical models are superimposed. Spectro™ selects the best matching models; non-fitting replicas are rejected. Data fusion then correlates the values of the key parameters to derive capacity and CCA estimations.The Nyquist plot was invented by Harry Nyquist (1889–1976) while at Bell Laboratories in the USA. The parametric plot presents the frequency response of a linear system displaying both amplitude and phase angle on a single scheme using frequency as parameter. The horizontal x-axis of a Nyquist plot reveals the real ohm impedance while the vertical y-axis represents the imaginary impedance.\nFigure 7: Spectro A+ with printer checks starter batteries in 15 seconds.U.S. patent 7,072,871\nSpectro™ scans the battery with a frequency spectrum as if to capture the topography of a landscape and then compares the imprint with stored matrices to estimate battery capacity, CCA and SoC. Typical applications are warranty verification on new vehicle batteries and predicting battery end-of-life by estimating capacity as part of after-service. Figure 7 illustrates the Spectro A+ with printer.\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "content": "New technologies often lead to “innovative blind spots,” and this is happening with electrification in batteries. Lithium-ion is a winning chemistry to store electrical energy but there is fear of failure that often starts in a faulty cell that propagates and engulfs the battery in fire. Such incidents are known with e-bike batteries and other devices.\nCadex is developing a technology that reads the electrochemical evidence of a battery with a frequency scan and displays the results in a Nyquist plot. Figure 1 demonstrates Nyquist plots taken from 100 high-quality 8650 Li-ion cells with Spectro Explore.\nThe Spectro Explorer services Li-ion and lead acid batteries from 3V to 48V with capacities of up to 300Ah. The test is minimally-invasive with a frequency scan from 2,000Hz down to 0.1Hz that takes about 30 seconds; longer for large batteries. Applications for the Explorer are quality control in manufacturing, examining uniformity of incoming batteries, and battery validation before shipment. Best results are achieved with preparations such as a prior full charge, followed by a short rest.\nDormant lead acid batteries develop sulfation, a deficiency that can be removed with exercise if the sulfation is soft. Hard sulfation that occurs during long dormancy at low charge can be permanent.\nPrimary lithium batteries also develop passivation while in storage as illustrated in BU-701: How to Prime Batteries (Figure 2). The passivation layer is removable with a brief discharge. These are added services that a Nyquist scan can discover.\nA Nyquist plot consists of a resistive reading (Real Z) that is positioned on the horizontal axis, and a reactive analysis placed on the vertical axis. The resulting signature reflecting battery characteristics is divided into migration at high frequency on the left of the scale; charge transfer in mid-range; and diffusion at low frequencies on the right.\nFigure 2 illustrates a Nyquist plot serving as “golden sample” with adjustable pass/fail envelopes to set acceptance levels for quality control in manufacturing and performance check before deployment.\nFigure 3 compares Nyquist plots with different battery performances, Figure 4 overlays a Nyquist plot of a good battery with one of low capacity and Figure 5 illustrates a battery with dendrite growth. Figure 6 compares Nyquist signature of aged lead acid batteries with sulfated packs. Unless otherwise noted all readings were taken at the Cadex labs in Canada and Germany.\nLead acid batteries stored for six months or longer develop sulfation; a dormancy effect that reduces performance but is reversible by exercise if done in time. Figure 7 shows the Nyquist plots of a lead acid battery that had a low charge transfer with a capacity reading of 75% when first serviced. After exercise with a charge/discharge cycle, charge acceptance improved and the capacity increased to 92%. Other lead acid batteries tested with various dormancy effects had similar improvements. More studies are needed in how the Nyquist can identify sulfation that lead to restoration\nE-bike batteries are failing and in some cases catching fire. However, handled correctly, Li-ion is safe but the chemistry is less forgiving than lead acid and nickel-based chemistries. BU-304a and BU-304b advise how to keep Li-ion safe.\nWe now scan batteries with the Explorer in an entire pack, as well as in parallel pairs. Figure 8 shows an open e-bike battery; Figures 9, 10 and 11 show the test results.\nWith acquired knowledge, a Nyquist plot can easily be deciphered by technical staff. The task is simplified by comparing a faulty pack with a good one, knows as golden sample.\nAs Figure 9 illustrates, a normal pack has a small footprint that is contained in the user-adjustable Acceptance Field, while a faulty battery steps outside set limits. The shapes of the “cat tails” may one day lead to identifying the nature of defect.\nFigure 10 shows an entire pack with one cell shorted. The graph also does a comparison with a parallel pair in which all cells are good as shown in the small oval. Adding one bad apple changes the order.\nProtection circuit and series connections add non-reactive resistance that shift the Nyquist plot of the pack to the right.\nMixing non-reactive resistance with the reactive component of a battery is further exemplified in Figure 11. Here the protection circuit and long cables move the Nyquist plot to the right while retaining the signature of the Nyquist plot. The shift reflects the pure resistive part of the battery that will also assist in troubleshooting.\nTesting batteries by EIS is not new, but scientists predict that future battery diagnostics rests in EIS analysis. Evaluation by Nyquist using the Spectro Explorer has the potential of becoming a household name, led by versatility, ease of use and low cost. Using these technologies will reduce innovative blind spots to maintain safety as the world electrifies with batteries. Typical EIS applications include:\nAccording to the UL Research Institute, thermal runaway is a primary cause of fire in Li-ion.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Will the Reusable Alkaline Battery have a Future?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/will-the-reusable-alkaline-battery-have-a-future",
        "content": "The reusable alkaline was introduced in 1992 as an alternative to disposable batteries. The battery was promoted as a low-cost power source for consumer goods. Attempts were made to open markets for wireless communications, medical and defense. But the big breakthrough never came. Today, the reusable alkaline occupies only a small market and its use is limited to portable entertainment devices and flashlights. The lack of market appeal is regrettable when considering the environmental benefit of having to discard fewer batteries. It is said that the manufacturing cost of the reusable alkaline is only marginally higher than the primary cell. The idea of recharging alkaline batteries is not new. Although not endorsed by manufacturers, ordinary alkaline batteries have been recharged in households for many years. Recharging these batteries is only effective, however, if the cells have been discharged to less than 50% of their total capacity. The number of recharges depends solely on the depth of discharge and is limited to a few cycles at best. With each recharge, the amount of capacity the cell can hold is reduced. There is a cautionary advisory. Charging ordinary alkaline batteries may generate hydrogen gas, which can lead to explosion. It is not prudent to charge ordinary alkaline unsupervised.The reusable alkaline is designed for repeated recharge. Also here,, there is a loss of charge acceptance with each recharge. The longevity of the reusable alkaline is a direct function of the depth of discharge; the deeper the discharge, the fewer cycles the battery can endure.Tests performed by Cadex on 'AA' reusable alkaline cells showed a high capacity reading on the first discharge. In fact, the energy density was similar to that of nickel-metal-hydride. After the battery was fully discharged and recharged using the manufacturer's charger, the reusable alkaline settled at 60%, a capacity slightly below that of nickel-cadmium. Repeat cycling in the same manner resulted in a fractional capacity loss with each cycle. The discharge current in the tests was adjusted to 200mA (0.2 C-rate, or one fifth of the rated capacity); the end-of-discharge threshold was set to 1V/cell.An additional limitation of the reusable alkaline system is its high internal resistance, resulting in a load current capability of only 400mA (lower than 400mA provides better results). Although adequate for portable radios receivers, CD players, tape players and flashlights, 400mA is insufficient to power most mobile phones and video cameras.The reusable alkaline is inexpensive to buy but the cost per cycle is high when compared to other rechargeable batteries. Whereas nickel-cadmium checks in at $0.04US per cycle based on 1500 cycles, the reusable alkaline costs $0.50 based on 10 full discharge cycles. For many applications, this seemingly high cost is still economical when compared to primary alkaline that provides a one-time use. By only partially discharging the reusable alkaline, an improved cycle life is possible. At 50% depth of discharge, 50 cycles can be expected.To compare the operating cost between the standard and reusable alkaline, a study was done on flashlight batteries for hospital use. The reusable alkaline achieved measurable cost savings in the low?intensity care unit in which the flashlights were used only occasionally. The high-intensity care unit, which used the flashlights constantly, did not attain the same result. Deeper discharge and more frequent recharge reduced the service life and offset any cost advantage over the standard alkaline battery.When considering reusable alkaline, one must realize that the initial energy is slightly lower than that of the standard alkaline. Each subsequent recharge/charge cycle causes the capacity to decrease. Cost savings are realized if the batteries are never fully discharged but have a change to be recharged often.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-704e: Battery for Personal and Fleet Use",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-1004-battery-for-personal-and-fleet-use",
        "content": "It is interesting to observe that batteries cared for by a single user generally last longer than those operating in an open fleet system where everyone has access but no one is responsible. A personal user is one who operates a mobile phone, a laptop or digital camera for business or pleasure. He or she usually cares for the battery and makes all efforts to follow the recommended guidelines. With time, the user gets to know the battery like a good friend, and critical failures are rare because the owner adjusts to the changing condition, lowers expectations and replaces the pack when it becomes a nuisance.\nThe desire to care for the batteries is not witnessed among fleet users. The packs belong to a pool of unknown batteries and operate in a sharing arrangement. While an individual user can live with reduced runtime, the fleet operators have little attachment to the battery and show no patience with anything that is less than perfect. They grab a battery from the charger and expect it to last through the shift. At the end of the day, the battery is plugged into the charger again, ready for the next user. Having serviced batteries for fleet users for many years, I noticed shorter service life on fleet packs than those for personal use.\nHow can fleet batteries be made to last longer? I made an interesting observation on battery life in comparing two defense organizations, the US Army and the Dutch Army, both of which I had the pleasure of visiting. The armies in question use fleet batteries and deploy them similarly with the following exception.\nThe US Army issues batteries without a maintenance program. If the battery fails, another pack is released, no questions asked. Little or no care is taken and the failure rate is high. The Dutch Army, on the other hand, has moved away from the open fleet system by making the soldiers responsible for their batteries. The entrusted packs become part of their personal belongings, similar to food and clothing. The army made the change to reduce operational costs and improve reliability.\nThe results are startling. Since the Dutch Army adapted this new regime, the failure rate has dropped considerably and battery performance has increased. Unexpected downtime has almost been eliminated.\nI should mention that the Dutch Army used nickel-cadmium batteries at the time of the study. Each pack received periodic maintenance on a Cadex battery analyzer to prolong service life. Batteries that did not meet the required 80 percent target capacity were reconditioned, and those failing to meet the target setting were replaced. Meanwhile, the US Army had switched to nickel-metal-hydride, a chemistry that is known to offer higher capacity but shorter service life. Today, both armies use lithium-ion on their new equipment.\nPublic safety organizations use a mix of NiCd, NiMH and Li-ion. Checking with a fire department to find out which chemistry works best, I learned that Li-ion is indeed superior. After 15 months of use, the Li-ion batteries tested on a Cadex battery analyzer still showed 92–95 percent capacity, and the users are confident that the batteries can be used reliably for two to three full shifts on a single charge. Such performance would not have been possible with nickel-based batteries. But battery breakdowns still occur and the failure rate continues to be relatively high in fleet use. This might be user-related, and the Dutch Army model of assigning a battery as a personal belonging might solve this problem.\nThe lighter weight and longer runtime of Li-ion also offers noticeable advantages for power tools. Stores say that Li-ion batteries generate fewer returns than nickel-based packs, and this is in part due to the protection circuit that prevents reverse polarization on overload. Medical instruments are also switching to Li-ion but regulatory conditions make the change cumbersome. Bureaucracy can indeed stifle new technology rather than promote it.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-301a: Types of Battery Cells",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-301a-types-of-battery-cells",
        "content": "As batteries were beginning to be mass-produced, the jar design changed to the cylindrical format. The large F cell for lanterns was introduced in 1896 and the D cell followed in 1898. With the need for smaller cells, the C cell followed in 1900, and the popular AA was introduced in 1907. See BU-301: Standardizing Batteries into Norms.\nThe cylindrical cell continues to be one of the most widely used packaging styles for primary and secondary batteries. The advantages are ease of manufacture and good mechanical stability. The tubular cylinder can withstand high internal pressures without deforming.\nMany lithium and nickel-based cylindrical cells include a positive thermal coefficient (PTC) switch. When exposed to excessive current, the normally conductive polymer heats up and becomes resistive, stopping current flow and acting as short circuit protection. Once the short is removed, the PTC cools down and returns to the conductive state.\nMost cylindrical cells also feature a pressure relief mechanism, and the simplest design utilizes a membrane seal that ruptures under high pressure. Leakage and dry-out may occur after the membrane breaks. Re-sealable vents with a spring-loaded valve are the preferred design. Some consumer Li-ion cells include the Charge Interrupt Device (CID) that physically and irreversibly disconnect the cell when activated to an unsafe pressure builds up. Figure 1 shows a cross section of a cylindrical cell.\nTypical applications for the cylindrical cell are power tools, medical instruments, laptops and e-bikes. To allow variations within a given size, manufacturers use partial cell lengths, such as half and three-quarter formats, and nickel-cadmium provides the largest variety of cell choices. Some spilled over to nickel-metal-hydride, but not to lithium-ion as this chemistry established its own formats. The 18650 illustrated in Figure 2 remains one of the most popular cell packages. Typical applications for the 18650 Li-ion are power tools, medical devices, laptops and e-bikes.\nIn 2013, 2.55 billion 18650 cells were produced. Early Energy Cells had 2.2Ah; this was replaced with the 2.8Ah cell. The new cells are now 3.1Ah with an increase to 3.4Ah by 2017. Cell manufacturers are preparing for the 3.9Ah 18650.\nThe 18650 could well be the most optimized cell; it offers one of the lowest costs per Wh and has good reliability records. As consumers move to the flat designs in smart phones and tablets, the demand for the 18650 is fading and Figure 3 shows the over-supply that is being corrected thanks to the demand of the Tesla electric vehicles that also uses this cell format for now. As of end of 2016, the battery industry fears battery shortages to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles.\nThe demand for the 18650 would have peaked in 2011 had it not been for new demands in military, medical and drones, including the Tesla electric car. The switch to a flat-design in consumer products and larger format for the electric powertrain will eventually saturate the 18650. A new entry is the 21700.\nThere are other cylindrical Li-ion formats with dimensions of 20700, 21700 and 22700. Meanwhile, Tesla, Panasonic and Samsung have decided on the 21700 for easy of manufacturing, optimal capacity and other benefits. While the 18650 has a volume of approximately 16cm3 (16ml) with a capacity of around 3000mAh, the 21700 cell has approximately 24cm3 (24ml) with a said capacity of up to 6000mAh, essentially doubling the capacity with a 50% increase in volume. Tesla Motor refers to their company’s new 21700 as the “highest energy density cell that is also the cheapest.” (The 2170 nomenclature Tesla advocates is not totally correct; the last zero of the 21700 model describes a cylindrical cell harmonizing with the IEC standard.)\nThe larger 26650 cell with a diameter of 26mm does not enjoy the same popularity as the 18650. The 26650 is commonly used in load-leveling systems. A thicker cell is said to be harder to build than a thinner one. Making the cell longer is preferred. There is also a 26700 made by E-One Moli Energy.\nSome lead acid systems also borrow the cylindrical design. Known as the Hawker Cyclone, this cell offers improved cell stability, higher discharge currents and better temperature stability compared to the conventional prismatic design. The Hawker Cyclone has its own format.\nEven though the cylindrical cell does not fully utilize the space by creating air cavities on side-by-side placement, the 18650 has a higher energy density than a prismatic/pouch Li-ion cell. The 3Ah 18650 delivers 248Ah/kg, whereas a modern pouch cell has about 140Ah/kg. The higher energy density of the cylindrical cell compensates for its less ideal stacking abilities and the empty space can always be used for cooling to improve thermal management.\nCell disintegration cannot always be prevented but propagation can. Cylindrical cells are often spaced apart to stop propagation should one cell take off. Spacing also helps in the thermal management. In addition, a cylindrical design does not change size. In comparison, a 5mm prismatic cell can expand to 8mm with use and allowances must be made.\nThe button cell, also known as coin cell, enabled compact design in portable devices of the 1980s. Higher voltages were achieved by stacking the cells into a tube. Cordless telephones, medical devices and security wands at airports used these batteries.\nAlthough small and inexpensive to build, the stacked button cell fell out of favor and gave way to more conventional battery formats. A drawback of the button cell is swelling if charged too rapidly. Button cells have no safety vent and can only be charged at a 10- to 16-hour charge; however, newer designs claim rapid charge capability.\nMost button cells in use today are non-rechargeable and are found in medical implants, watches, hearing aids, car keys and memory backup. Figure 4 illustrates the button cells with a cross section.\nIntroduced in the early 1990s, the modern prismatic cell satisfies the demand for thinner sizes. Wrapped in elegant packages resembling a box of chewing gum or a small chocolate bar, prismatic cells make optimal use of space by using the layered approach. Other designs are wound and flattened into a pseudo-prismatic jelly roll. These cells are predominantly found in mobile phones, tablets and low-profile laptops ranging from 800mAh to 4,000mAh. No universal format exists and each manufacturer designs its own.\nPrismatic cells are also available in large formats. Packaged in welded aluminum housings, the cells deliver capacities of 20–50Ah and are primarily used for electric powertrains in hybrid and electric vehicles. Figure 5 shows the prismatic cell.\nThe prismatic cell improves space utilization and allows flexible design but it can be more expensive to manufacture, less efficient in thermal management and have a shorter cycle life than the cylindrical design. Allow for some swelling.\nThe prismatic cell requires a firm enclosure to achieve compression. Some swelling due to gas buildup is normal, and growth allowance must be made; a 5mm (0.2”) cell can grow to 8mm (0.3”) after 500 cycles. Discontinue using the battery if the distortion presses against the battery compartment. Bulging batteries can damage equipment and compromise safety.\nIn 1995, the pouch cell surprised the battery world with a radical new design. Rather than using a metallic cylinder and glass-to-metal electrical feed-through, conductive foil-tabs were welded to the electrodes and brought to the outside in a fully sealed way. Figure 6 illustrates a pouch cell.\nThe pouch cell offers a simple, flexible and lightweight solution to battery design. Some stack pressure is recommended but allowance for swelling must be made. The pouch cells can deliver high load currents but it performs best under light loading conditions and with moderate charging.\nThe pouch cell makes most efficient use of space and achieves 90–95 percent packaging efficiency, the highest among battery packs. Eliminating the metal enclosure reduces weight, but the cell needs support and allowance to expand in the battery compartment. The pouch packs are used in consumer, military and automotive applications. No standardized pouch cells exist; each manufacturer designs its own.\nPouch packs are commonly Li-polymer. Small cells are popular for portable applications requiring high load currents, such as drones and hobby gadgets. The larger cells in the 40Ah range serve in energy storage systems (ESS) because fewer cells simplify the battery design.\nAlthough easily stackable, provision must be made for swelling. While smaller pouch packs can grow 8–10 percent over 500 cycles, large cells may expand to that size in 5,000 cycles. It is best not to stack pouch cells on top of each other but to lay them flat, side by side or allow extra space in between them. Avoid sharp edges that can stress the pouch cells as they expand.\nExtreme swelling is a concern. Users of pouch packs have reported up to 3 percent swelling incidents on a poor batch run. The pressure created can crack the battery cover, and in some cases, break the display and electronic circuit boards. Discontinue using an inflated battery and do not puncture the bloating cell in close proximity to heat or fire. The escaping gases can ignite. Figure 7 shows a swollen pouch cell.\nSwelling can occur due to gassing. Improvements are being made with newer designs. Large pouch cells designs experience less swelling. The gases contain mainly CO2 (carbon dioxide) and CO (carbon monoxide).\nPouch cells are manufactured by adding a temporary “gasbag” on the side. Gases escape into the gasbag while forming the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) during the first charge. The gasbag is cut off and the pack is resealed as part of the finishing process. Forming a solid SEI is key to good formatting practices. Subsequent charges should produce minimal gases, however, gas generation, also known as gassing, cannot be fully avoided. It is caused by electrolyte decomposition as part of usage and aging. Stresses, such as overcharging and overheating promote gassing. Ballooning with normal use often hints to a flawed batch.\nThe technology has matured and prismatic and pouch cells have the potential for greater capacity than the cylindrical format. Large flat packs serve electric powertrains and Energy Storage System (ESS) with good results. The cost per kWh in the prismatic/pouch cell is still higher than with the 18650 cell but this is changing. Figure 8 compares the price of the cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cells, also known as laminated. Flat-cell designs are getting price competitive and battery experts predict a shift towards these cell formats, especially if the same performance criteria of the cylindrical cell can be met.\nHistorically, manufacturing costs of prismatic and pouch formats (laminate) were higher, but they are converging with cellular design. Pricing involves the manufacturing of the bare cells only.\nAsian cell manufacturers anticipate cost reductions of the four most common Li-ion cells, which are the 18650, 21700, prismatic and pouch cells. The 21700 promises the largest cost decrease over the years and economical production, reaching price equilibrium with the pouch by 2025 (Figure 9).\nAutomation enables price equilibrium of the 21700 with the pouch cell in 2025. This does not include packaging where the prismatic and pouch cells have a cost advantages.\nFraunhofer predicts the fastest growth with the 21700 and the pouch cell while the popular 18650 will hold its own. Costs per kWh do not include BMS and packaging. The type cell chosen varies packaging costs as prismatic can easily be stacked; pouch cells may require some compression and cylindrical cells need support systems that create voids. Large packs for electric vehicle also include climate control that adds to cost.\nWith the pouch cell, the manufacturer is attempting to simplify cell manufacturing by replicating the packaging of food. Each format has pros and cons as summarized below.\n[1] Source: Sanyo[2] Source: Cadex Electronics[3] Source: Avicenne Energy[4] Source: Sanyo and Panasonic[5] Source: Polystor Energy Corporation[6] Source: A123[7] Source: Battery Experts Forum\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-407: Charging Nickel-cadmium",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-407-charging-nickel-cadmium",
        "content": "Nickel-based batteries are more complex to charge than Li-ion and lead acid. Lithium- and lead-based systems are charged with a regulated current to bring the voltage to a set limit after which the battery saturates until fully charged. This method is called constant current constant voltage (CCCV). Nickel-based batteries also charge with constant current but the voltage is allowed to rise freely. Full charge detection occurs by observing a slight voltage drop after a steady rise. This may be connected with plateau timing and temperature rise over time (more below).\nBattery manufacturers recommend that new batteries be slow-charged for 16–24 hours before use. A slow charge brings all cells in a battery pack to an equal charge level. This is important because each cell within the nickel-cadmium battery may have self-discharged at its own rate. Furthermore, during long storage the electrolyte tends to gravitate to the bottom of the cell and the initial slow charge helps in the redistribution to eliminate dry spots on the separator. (See also BU-803a: Loss of Electrolyte)\nBattery manufacturers do not fully format nickel- and lead-based batteries before shipment. The cells reach optimal performance after priming that involves several charge/discharge cycles. This is part of normal use; it can also be done with a battery analyzer. Quality cells are known to perform to full specifications after only 5–7 cycles; others may take 50–100 cycles. Peak capacity occurs between 100–300 cycles, after which the performance starts to drop gradually.\nMost rechargeable cells include a safety vent that releases excess pressure if incorrectly charged. The vent on a NiCd cell opens at 1,000–1,400kPa (150–200psi). Pressure released through a re-sealable vent causes no damage; however, with each venting event some electrolyte escapes and the seal may begin to leak. The formation of a white powder at the vent opening makes this visible. Multiple venting eventually results in a dry-out condition. A battery should never be stressed to the point of venting.\nFull-charge detection of sealed nickel-based batteries is more complex than that of lead acid and lithium-ion. Low-cost chargers often use temperature sensing to end the fast charge, but this can be inaccurate. The core of a cell is several degrees warmer than the skin where the temperature is measured, and the delay that occurs causes over-charge. Charger manufacturers use 50°C (122°F) as temperature cut-off. Although any prolonged temperature above 45°C (113°F) is harmful to the battery, a brief overshoot is acceptable as long as the battery temperature drops quickly when the “ready” light appears.\nAdvanced chargers no longer rely on a fixed temperature threshold but sense the rate of temperature increase over time, also known as delta temperature over delta time, or dT/dt. Rather than waiting for an absolute temperature to occur, dT/dt uses the rapid temperature increase towards the end of charge to trigger the “ready” light. The delta temperature method keeps the battery cooler than a fixed temperature cut-off, but the cells need to charge reasonably fast to trigger the temperature rise. Charge termination occurs when the temperature rises 1°C (1.8°F) per minute. If the battery cannot achieve the needed temperature rise, an absolute temperature cut-off set to 60°C (140°F) terminates the charge.\nChargers relying on temperature inflict harmful overcharges when a fully charged battery is repeatedly removed and reinserted. This is the case with chargers in vehicles and desktop stations where a two-way radio is being detached with each use. Reconnection initiates a new charge cycle that requires reheating of the battery.\nLi ion systems have an advantage in that voltage governs state-of-charge. Reinserting a fully charged Li-ion battery immediately pushes the voltage to the full-charge threshold, the current drops and the charger turns off shortly without needing to create a temperature signature.\nAdvanced chargers terminate charge when a defined voltage signature occurs. This provides a more precise full-charge detection of nickel-based batteries than temperature-based methods. The charger looks for a voltage drop that occurs when the battery has reached full charge. This method is called negative delta V (NDV).\nNDV is the recommended full-charge detection method for chargers applying a charge rate of 0.3C and higher. It offers a quick response time and works well with a partially or fully charged battery. When inserting a fully charged battery, the terminal voltage rises quickly and then drops sharply to trigger the ready state. The charge lasts only a few minutes and the cells remain cool. NiCd chargers with NDV detection typically respond to a voltage drop of 5mV per cell.\nTo achieve a reliable voltage signature, the charge rate must be 0.5C and higher. Slower charging produces a less defined voltage drop, especially if the cells are mismatched in which case each cell reaches full charge at a different time point. To assure reliable full-charge detection, most NDV chargers also use a voltage plateau detector that terminates the charge when the voltage remains in a steady state for a given time. These chargers also include delta temperature, absolute temperature and a time-out timer.\nFast charging improves the charge efficiency. At 1C charge rate, the efficiency of a standard NiCd is 91 percent and the charge time is about an hour (66 minutes at 91 percent). On a slow charger, the efficiency drops to 71 percent, prolonging the charge time to about 14 hours at 0.1C.\nDuring the first 70 percent of charge, the efficiency of a NiCd is close to 100 percent. The battery absorbs almost all energy and the pack remains cool. NiCd batteries designed for fast charging can be charged with currents that are several times the C-rating without extensive heat buildup. In fact, NiCd is the only battery that can be ultra-fast charged with minimal stress. Cells made for ultra-fast charging can be charged to 70 percent in minutes.\nFigure 1 shows the relationship of cell voltage, pressure and temperature of a charging NiCd. Everything goes well up to about 70 percent charge, when charge efficiency drops. The cells begin to generate gases, the pressure rises and the temperature increases rapidly. To reduce battery stress, some chargers lower the charge rate past the 70 percent mark.\nCharge efficiency is high up to 70% SoC* and then charge acceptances drops. NiMH is similar to NiCd. Charge efficiency measures the battery’s ability to accept charge and has similarities with coulombic efficiency.\n* SoC refers to relative state-of-charge (RSoC) reflecting the actual energy a battery can store. Full charge will show 100% even if the capacity has faded. (See BU-105: Battery Definition and what they mean)\nUltra-high-capacity NiCd batteries tend to heat up more than standard NiCds when charging at 1C and higher and this is partly due to increased internal resistance. Applying a high current at the initial charge and then tapering off to a lower rate as the charge acceptance decreases is a recommended fast charge method for these more fragile batteries. (See BU-208: Cycle Performance)\nInterspersing discharge pulses between charge pulses is known to improve charge acceptance of nickel-based batteries. Commonly referred to as a “burp” or “reverse load” charge, this method assists in the recombination of gases generated during charge. The result is a cooler and more effective charge than with conventional DC chargers. The method is also said to reduce the “memory” effect as the battery is being exercised with pulses. (See BU-807: How to Restore Nickel-based Batteries) While pulse charging may be valuable for NiCd and NiMH batteries, this method does not apply to lead- and lithium-based systems. These batteries work best with a pure DC voltage.\nAfter full charge, the NiCd battery receives a trickle charge of 0.05–0.1C to compensate for self-discharge. To reduce possible overcharge, charger designers aim for the lowest possible trickle charge current. In spite of this, it is best not to leave nickel-based batteries in a charger for more than a few days. Remove them and recharge before use.\nFlooded NiCd is charged with a constant current to about 1.55V/cell. The current is then reduced to 0.1C and the charge continues until 1.55V/cell is reached again. At this point, a trickle charge is applied and the voltage is allowed to float freely. Higher charge voltages are possible but this generates excess gas and causes rapid water depletion. NDV is not applicable as the flooded NiCd does not absorb gases because it is not under pressure.\n[1] Source: Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Not all battery energy can or should be used on discharge; some reserve is almost always left behind on purpose after the equipment cuts off. There are several reasons for this.\nMost mobile phones, laptops and other portable devices turn off when the lithium-ion battery reaches 3.00V/cell on discharge. At this point the battery has about 5 percent capacity left. Manufacturers choose this voltage threshold to preserve some energy for housekeeping, as well as to reduce battery stress and allow for some self-discharge if the battery is not immediately recharged. This grace period in empty state can last several months until self-discharge lowers the voltage of Li-ion to about 2.50V/cell, at which point the protection circuit opens and most packs become unserviceable with a regular charger(See BU-808a: How to awaken Sleeping Li-ion)\nPower tools and medical devices drawing high current tend to push the battery voltage to an early cut-off prematurely. This is especially apparent at cold temperatures and in cells with high internal resistance. These batteries may still have ample capacity left after the cutoff; discharging them with a battery analyzer at a moderate load will often give a residual capacity of 30 percent. Figure 1 illustrates the cut-off voltage graphically.\nTo prevent triggering premature cutoff at a high load or cold temperature, some device manufacturers may lower the end-of-discharge voltage. Li-ion in a power tool may discharge the battery to 2.70V/cell instead of 3.00V/cell; Li-phosphate may go to 2.45V/cell instead of 2.70V/cell, lead acid to 1.40V/cell instead of the customary 1.75V/cell, and NiCd/NiMH to 0.90V/cell instead of 1.00V/cell(See BU-501: Basics About Discharging)\nIndustrial applications aim to attain maximum service life rather than optimize runtime, as it is done with consumer products. This also applies to the electric powertrain; batteries in a hybrid cars and electric vehicle electric vehicles are seldom fully discharged or charged; most operate between 30 and 80 percent state-of-charge when new. This is the most effective working bandwidth; it also delivers the longest service life. A deep discharge to empty followed a full charge would cause undue stress for the Li-ion. Similarly, satellites use only the mid-band of a battery called the “sweet zone.” Figure 2 illustrates the “sweet zone” of a battery.\nOperating Li-ion in the “sweet zone” prolongs battery life because a partial cycle is less stressful than a full cycle. As the capacity fades with use, the battery management system (BMS) may engage the full working range of the battery.\nElevated internal resistance makes alkaline and other primary batteries unsuitable for high load applications. The resistance rises further as the cell depletes. This causes an early cutoff with the device drawing some current, and much energy is left behind. Primary batteries have high capacities and perform well when new, but they soon lose power like a deflating balloon(See BU-106: Primary Batteries)\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Are Hybrid Cars Here to Stay?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/are-hybrid-cars-here-to-stay",
        "content": "The hybrid car is not new - Ferdinand Porsche designed the series-hybrid vehicle in 1898. Called the Lohner-Porsche carriage, the hybrid function served as an electrical transmission rather than power boost. With Mr. Porsche in the driver's seat, the car broke several Austrian speed records, including the Exelberg Rally in 1901. Another example of an early hybrid was the 1915 Woods Motor Vehicle built in Chicago. The car used a four-cylinder internal combustion engine and an electric motor. Below 15 mph (25 km/h), the electric motor propelled the vehicle; at higher speeds, the gasoline engine kicked in to take the vehicle up to a top speed of 35 mph (55 km/h). As part of the Federal Clean Car Incentive Program, Victor Wouk installed a hybrid drive train in a 1972 GM Buick Skylark but the EPA canceled the program in 1976. Meanwhile, Honda and Toyota have made strong headways by commercializing attractive and fuel-efficient hybrid cars.The hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) conserves fuel by using an electric motor that assists the internal-combustion engine (IC) on acceleration and harnesses kinetic energy during breaking. Furthermore, the IC motor turns off at stops and during slow travel. When full power is required, both the IC engine and the electric motors engage simultaneously to get maximum boost. This power-sharing scheme offers two advantages; it calls for a smaller IC engine and improves acceleration because the electric motor has excellent torque characteristics. Most HEVs use a mechanical drive train from the IC engine to the wheels. In this respect, the HEV is similar to an ordinary vehicle with crankshaft, clutch and transmission, with the difference of having an electric motor and a battery. This design is known as a parallel configuration. Most up-and-coming plug-in HEVs use the serial configuration in which the wheels are powered by one or several electric motors. Instead of a mechanical link, the IC engine energizes a generator to produce electricity for the motor(s). Similar to a laptop or a cell phone, the driver plugs the car into the AC outlet for an overnight charge. The typical driving range with a full charge is 20 miles or 32 km. On long trips, the IC engine engages to provide continuous power for the electric motors.\nThe early HEV models used lead acid batteries because there was no alternative. Today, Honda and Toyota employ nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH). This chemistry is lighter and environmentally friendlier than lead-based systems. The battery consists of cylindrical cells that are connected in series to attain several hundred volts. The cell strings are suspended in mid air to allow air-cooling. Figure 1 shows a demonstration pack of an early Toyota hybrid car battery.\nOne of the critical battery requirements for hybrid applications is longevity. Rechargeable batteries for consumer products typically last for two to three years. This short service life is no major drawback with cell phones, laptops and digital cameras because the devices get obsolete quickly. At $2,000 to $3,000 per battery pack, the replacement cost of an HEV battery would constitute a major expense. Most batteries for HEV are guaranteed for eight years. To meet this long service life, the cells are optimized for longevity and not size and weight, as is the case with portable applications. Since the battery runs on wheels, the increased weight and size is not too critical. A NiMH for an HEV can be charged and discharged 1,000 times if done at an 80% depth-of-discharge. In a hybrid vehicle, a full discharge occurs seldom except if the owner lives on a mountain and requires all available battery power to commute home. Such a routine would add stress to the battery and the life would be shortened. In most other application, the hybrid car only uses 10% of the rated battery capacity. This allows thousands of charge/discharge cycles. Batteries in satellites use a similar system in which the battery discharges less than 10% during a satellite night. NASA achieves this by over-sizing the battery. One of the limitations of NiMH is moderate energy conversion efficiency. This translates to the battery getting hot on charge and discharge. The charge efficiency is best at 50-70% state-of-charge. Above 70% the battery cannot absorb the charge well and much of the charging energy is lost in heat. Operating a battery with a partial charge requires a larger mass that lowers the energy-to-weight ratio and efficiency.The Japanese car manufacturers have tried several battery chemistries, including going back to lead acid. Today, the focus is on lithium-ion. The cobalt-based lithium-ion is one of the first chemistries in the lithium family and offers a very high energy density. Unfortunately, this battery system cannot deliver high currents and is restricted to portable applications.HEV manufacturers are experimenting with manganese (spinel) and phosphate versions. These lithium-ion systems offer an extremely low internal resistance, deliver high load currents and accept rapid charge. Unlike the cobalt version, the resistance stays low throughout the life of the battery. To verify the characteristic of manganese-based lithium-ion, a research lab applied 30,000 discharge/charge cycles over a period of seven years. Although the capacity dropped from 100% to 20%, the cell retained its low internal resistance. The drawback of manganese and phosphate is lower energy density but these systems provide 20% more capacity per weight than NiMH and three times more than lead acid. Figure 2 illustrates the energy densities of the lead, nickel and lithium-ion systems. It should be noted that lithium-ion systems have the potential of higher energy densities but at the cost of lower safety and reduced cycle life.\nThe Lithium-ion systems are promising candidates for both the HEV and plug-in HEV but require more research. Here are some of the roadblocks that need to be removed: Durability: The buyer requests a warranty of ten years and more. Currently, the battery manufacturer for hybrid electric vehicles can only give eight years on NiMH. The longevity of lithium-ion has not yet been proven and honoring eight years will be a challenge. Cost: If the $2,000 to $3,000 replacement cost of a nickel-metal-hydride pack is prohibitive, lithium-ion will be higher. These systems are more expensive to produce than most other chemistries but have the potential for price reductions through improved manufacturing methods. NiMH has reached the low cost plateau and cannot be reduced further because of high nickel prices.Safety: Manganese and phosphate-based lithium-ion batteries are inherently safer than cobalt. Cobalt gets thermally unstable at a moderate temperature of 150°C (300°F). Manganese and phosphate cells can reach 250°C (480°F) before becoming unsafe. In spite of the increased thermal stability, the battery requires expensive protection circuits to supervise the cell voltages and limit the current in fail conditions. The safety circuit will also need to compensate for cell mismatch that occurs naturally with age. The recent reliability problems with lithium-ion batteries in portable devices may delay entry into the HEV market.Availability: Manufacturers of manganese and phosphate cells can hardly keep up with the demand. A rapid increase of lithium for HEV batteries would put a squeeze on battery production. With 7 kg (15 lb) of lithium per battery, there is talk of raw material shortages. Most of the known supplies of lithium are in South America, Argentina, Chile and Bolivia.\nImagine a plug-in electric vehicle that can go 20 miles (32 km) with a single charge from the electrical outlet at home. There is no pollution and the neighbors won't hear you coming and going because the vehicle is totally silent. With the absence of gas tax, the road system is yours to use for free. Or is it?As good as this may sound, the savings will be small or non-existent because of the battery. Dr. Menahem Anderman, a leading expert on advanced automobile batteries, says that we still have no suitable battery for the plug-in HEV and that the reliability of lithium-ion technology for automotive applications has not yet been proven. Unlike the ordinary HEV that operates on shallow charges and discharges, the plug-in HEV is in charge depletion mode that requires deep discharges. To obtain an acceptable driving range, the PHEV battery will need to be five times larger than the HEV battery. With an estimated life span of 1000 full charge and discharge cycles, the battery would need to be replaced every three years. At an estimated $10,000 per battery replacement, the anticipated cost savings would be quickly exhausted. Modern cars do more than provide transportation; they also include auxiliary devices for safety, comfort and pleasure. The most basic of these auxiliaries are the headlights and windshield wipers. Most buyers would also want heating and air-conditioning systems. These amenities are taken for granted in gasoline-powered vehicles and will need to be used sparingly in a PHEV. Analysts give another 10 years before a viable plug-in HEV will be available. The promise of a clean-burning fuel cell car is still vivid in our memory. Analysts now estimate 20 years before the fuel cell is ready for mass-produced cars. There are rumors that the fuel cell may never make it into an ordinary car. If this is true, a dream will go down in history with the steam-powered airplane of the mid 1800s that was simply too cumbersome to fly.\nAt the Advanced Automotive Battery Conference in Hawaii, a delegate member challenged a maker of HEVs with the claim that a German diesel car can get better fuel economy than the hybrid. The presiding speaker, being a trained salesman, flatly denied this notion. There is some truth to his claim, however. On the highway, the diesel car is indeed more fuel-efficient but the HEV has the advantage in city driving. Power boost for fast acceleration and regenerative breaking are advantages that the German diesel does not offer. Someone then asked, \"What would happen if the HEV depletes its batteries while driving up a long mountain pass? Will the car have enough power?\" The answer was that the car would make it with the IC engine alone but the maneuverability would be restraint. To compensate for this eventuality, some HEV manufacturers offer SUVs featuring a full-sized IC motor of 250 hp and an electrical motor at 150 hp; 400 hp in total. Such a vehicle would surly find buyers, especially if the government provides grant money for being 'green.' It's unfortunate that the buyers of a small car or the commuters taking public transport won't qualify for such a handout.\nWe anticipate that lithium-ion will eventually replace nickel-metal-hydride in hybrid electric vehicles but short service life, high manufacturing costs and safety issues will stand in its way today. We need to remind ourselves that the automotive market can only tolerate a marginal cost increase for a new battery technology. In terms of added capacity, lithium-ion offers only a 20% increase in energy density per weight over nickel-based systems. The nickel-metal-hydride has proven to work well in current HEVs and a new chemistry would need to offer definite advantages over present systems to find buyers. Toyota, Honda and Ford are leading in HEV technology. Other major automakers are expected to offer competitive models by 2010. Currently, Panasonic EV Energy and Sanyo supply over 90% of the HEV batteries. Both companies are also developing lithium-ion batteries. While Japan and Korea are focusing on manganese systems, the USA is experimenting with phosphate, the chemistry that made the A123 Systems famous. Europe is relying on clean-burning diesel. These engines are so clean that they won't even stain a tissue that is placed on the exhaust pipe. BMW is working on a zero emission hydrogen car. Time will tell who will be the winner in the race for cleaner, more fuel-savvy vehicles and longer-living cars. In terms of longevity, the diesel would be the winner today. We hope that future batteries will one-day have the endurance to match or exceed the robust diesel engine.

        "content": "Research firms and trade associations report increased failure rates of starter batteries in modern cars. The reason for the shorter than expected service life is blamed on in-car technology systems that draw high current and prevent a fully charged battery. Other failures are heat related stresses that occur when driving in hot climates. Fewer than 7% of reported problems are caused by factory defects(See BU-901: Fundamentals in Battery Testing)\nBattery failures are in part influenced by driving habits, the liberal use of auxiliary loads, hot climate conditions, start-stop and battery mount. Sometimes a battery failure can be caused by the buildup of conductive materials across the battery posts that induce an ionic discharge. Always keep the battery top and posts clean. This also applies to storing batteries.\nEven under the best conditions, a quality battery ages and this manifests itself in a gradual drop of capacity. Common failures of starter batteries include:\nCapacity loss that occurs naturally with usage is illustrated as a build-up of rocks. Capacity and CCA do not correlate.\nThe most common specification of a starter battery is CCA representing cold cranking amps. Batteries also specify capacity, the electrical storage capability that is marked in ampere-hours (Ah) or Reserve Capacity (RC) in minutes. Europe uses Ah while North America goes for RC(See BU-904: How to Measure Capacity)\nFigure 2 illustrates a battery with low CCA that is dying after 1–2 years because of heat failure. A typical cause is corrosion that raises the internal battery resistance and lowers the CCA. The capacity remains steady but it cannot be delivered due to low CCA. Replace a battery when CCA drops to 50%.\nSymptoms: Poor cranking due to high internal resistance. Failure mode is gradual and gives early warning.Test Method: AC conductance or impedance reader. Replace battery when CCA drops to 50%.\nFigure 3 shows the natural decrease of CCA and capacity on a well maintained battery. The pack will eventually fail at a ripe old age due to low capacity while CCA is still in working range. A ‘no-start’ occurs when the capacity drops below a required capacity level to crank the engine. A starter battery should be replaced when the capacity drops to 40 percent.\nSymptoms: Capacity fade goes unnoticed and the failure appears sudden. Check capacity as part of preventative service.Test Method: Rapid-test with Spectro™. Full discharge with load bank is not recommended.\nA starter battery must have low internal resistance and sufficient capacity to enable cranking. CCA and capacity can be presented on a two-dimensional table by plotting CCA on the vertical and capacity on the horizontal axis. Figure 4 demonstrates three batteries in various conditions.\nA starter battery can fail by heat failure or capacity fade. Both faults are permanent and cannot be reversed. CCA relates to internal resistance that is easy to measure; capacity reflects energy storage that is more complex to estimate.\nA battery tester should examine CCA and capacity. CCA and capacity do not correlate. Each reading is unique, of which capacity is the more complex to estimate(See also BU-806: Tracking Battery Capacity and Resistance as part of Aging)\nTo study failure modes, a German luxury car maker tested 175 starter batteries. Figure 5 plots capacity and CCA of this extensive test that lasted six-months. Heat failed batteries were excluded.\nMost batteries pass through the Capacity Line; few fail because of low CCA. The test batteries were trunk mounted and driven in a moderate climate.\nNote: Test was done by a German luxury car manufacturer. Heat damaged batteries were excluded. Test Method: Capacity and CCA were tested according to DIN and IEC standards.\nAs the graph illustrates, most batteries pass through the Capacity Line on the left of the green field. Very few fail by dropping through the CCA Line. Without ability to estimate capacity, batteries with high CCA pass as good, only to fail on the road because of low capacity. Meanwhile, good batteries are being replaced in error. CCA alone cannot predict the end of battery life. CCA tends to stay high while the capacity drops predictably. The Figure 6 illustrates this phenomenon on 20 aging batteries.\nStarter batteries cannot be tested by CCA alone as the reading of a normally aging battery tends to stay high while capacity drops predictably with age.\nTest Method: CCA was taken with Spectro CA-12; capacity was measured with an Agilent load bank by applying full discharges according to BCI standards.\nSpectro CA-12 is a battery rapid-tester that is capable of estimating CCA, capacity and SoC of 12V starter batteries. The CCA range is 100–1,200A, capacity range is 30–105Ah or 60–210 minutes in RC.\nTo test a starter battery, select between flooded and AGM, and then enter CCA and capacity ratings in ampere hours (Ah) or reserve capacity (RC). The battery should have a minimal SoC of 50%. The test time is 15 seconds.\nFor more information on battery test methods(See BU-902: How to Measure Internals Resistance)\nNote: The Spectro CA-12 is currently only available to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM)\nSpectro uses multi-model electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (Spectro™). This is a further development of electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), a technology that has been in use for many years. The non-invasive test scans the battery with multiple frequencies to generate a Nyquist plot. The Nyquist information is filtered and superimposed onto electrochemical models to derive battery state-of-health (SoH). Nyquist analysis is suitable to test lead acid and Li-ion batteries.\nThis is the first commercial application using “multi-model EIS” technology to estimate the state-of-health of a battery. The Spectro CA-12 is also the only instrument on the market capable of estimating capacity on the fly.\nIn medical terms, Spectro™ can be compared to a modern CAT scan. While the traditional X-ray machine only reflects shadowy outlines of a skeleton, the Spectro™ technology applied to batteries can see what doctors would refer to as soft tissues. Battery scientists predict that advanced battery diagnostics is gravitating towards EIS technologies using complex modeling.\n[1] Source: Cadex Electronics[2] J.

        "content": "Wireless charging may one day replace plugs and wires similar to how Bluetooth and Wi-Fi have modernized personal communication. The concept rests on inductive coupling using an electromagnetic field that transfers energy from the transmitter to the receiver.Wireless transfer of power is not new. In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered induction in sending electromagnetic force through space. In the late 1800s and the early 1900s, Nicola Tesla demonstrated wireless broadcasting and power transmission. The experiments in Colorado Springs in 1899 lead to the Wardenclyffe Tower in New York. Tesla wanted to prove that electrical power could be transmitted without wires, but lack of funding halted the project.It was not until the 1920s that public broadcasting began. Europe built massive transmitters to reach many countries. The transmitter at Beromünster in Switzerland could have transmitted at 600kW, but legislation on electro-smog and protests from the local population limited the power to 180kW. Smaller FM stations have since replaced these large national transmitters.Wireless charging shares similarities with radio transmission transmitting power by electro-magnetic fields. Wireless charging operates in a near field condition in which the primary coil produces a magnetic field that is picked up by the secondary coil in close proximity. The radio transmitter, on the other hand, works on the far field principle by sending waves that travel through space. While the receiving coil of the wireless charger captures most of the energy generated, the receiving antenna of the radio only needs a few microvolt (one millionth of a volt) to recover a signal that become intelligent when amplified.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "After fewer than 100,000 flight hours, two main batteries in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner failed. This contradicts Boeing’s estimate as part of certification that a smoke event involving the new Li-ion battery should only occur once in 10 million flight hours. More than a smoke event occurred, and one battery disintegrated in a thermal runaway with fire and the spewing of electrolyte that caused damage to the electronics bay (Figure 1). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the entire fleet of B-787 as a result.\nFigure 1: Damage in aft electronics bay caused by a burning battery in a Boeing 787\nThe incident happened after arriving at the gates in Boston from a flight from Narita, Japan. The fire was difficult to extinguish; smoke and flames didn’t break with the dry chemical of a fire extinguisher and airport firefighters used liquid Halotron.\nImage courtesy of the National Transportation Safety Board, Investigative update of battery fire on Japan Airlines B-787, 7 January 2013.Boeing chose lithium-ion to store more capacity at the same weight. The main battery is composed of eight GS Yuasa LVP10 cells and provides roughly twice the energy density compared to the traditional flooded nickel-cadmium (NiCd) that other aircraft use. The Dreamliner needs the extra capacity to run additional electrical systems, including hydraulic functions that have been electrified. Another reason for selecting Li-ion is low maintenance. Li-ion requires fewer scheduled services than NiCd, which needs regular full discharges to remove memory, adjustment of electrolyte and cleaning corrosion buildup.\nThe Boeing 787 is the first commercial aircraft to use Li-ion as its main battery, and there are risks associated with this. Hybrid vehicles only switched to Li-ion around 2010 with more stable chemistries. When the Li-ion battery was selected in 2005, the choices were limited and what we know today, the picked Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LiCoC2) may not be the best technology for onboard aviation. It is the same chemistry that triggered a major recall of computer and mobile phone batteries in 2006 when one-in-200,000 cells caused a breakdown.\nCT scans done on the failed main battery of the B-787 reveal a similar breakdown that prompted the 2006 recall: a damaged electrode in one of the eight Li-ion cells apparently caused an electrical short that triggered a thermal runaway with fire. Lithium Cobalt Oxide (Li-cobalt) is known to be less stable than other lithium-based systems. For consumer product wanting optimal runtime, Li-cobalt works well, but large formats have additional challenges. Figure 2 illustrates the damaged main aircraft battery.\nFigure 2: JAL Event Battery\nThe charred remains of the failed B-787 main battery featuring 8 GS Yuasa LVP10 lithium-ion cells. The safety circuit at the connector end of the battery is unable to stop a thermal runaway once in progress.\nCourtesy of the National Transportation Safety Board, Investigative update of battery fire on Japan Airlines B-787, 7 January 2013.\nIf the U.S. investigators fail to find the root cause of the battery fires, the technology could be deemed insufficiently mature for onboard aviation. Possible solutions are the use of other lithium-based batteries or moving back to NiCd.

NMC, NCM, CMN, CNM, MNC and MCN are similar.2 Application and environment govern cycle life; the numbers do not always apply correctly.3 A fully charged battery raises the thermal runaway temperature, a partial charge lowers it.\nThe performance of the different Li-ion systems can best be illustrated with spider webs. The graphics demonstrate specific energy (capacity); specific power, (current delivery); safety; performance (at hot and cold temperatures); life span (cycle life); and cost. The values are estimated and may vary.\nLi-cobalt is characterized by a high specific energy but moderate safety, life span and specific power. Li-cobalt should not be charged and discharged at currents exceeding the Ah rating. Forcing a fast charge or applying a load above 1C could cause overheating. The manufacturer recommends a charge C-rate of 0.8C, and most battery protection circuits for this chemistry limit the charge and discharge currents to about 1C (1A for a battery rated at 1Ah). The battery consists of a cobalt oxide cathode and a graphite carbon anode. Li-cobalt is one of the first lithium-ion batteries and is the preferred chemistry for laptops, mobile phones and digital cameras. Figure 2 summarizes the performance of Li-cobalt.\nFigure 2: Snapshot of an average Li-cobalt battery\nOne of the first Li-ion chemistries; offers high specific energy (capacity) but provides moderate performance in specific power, safety and life span. The relative high internal resistance causes the battery to heat up during high load and rapid charge.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nLithium manganese oxide as cathode material forms a three-dimensional spinel structure that improves ion flow on the electrodes. This results in a low internal resistance for good current handling and solid thermal stability. The negatives are low life span and a specific energy that is about one-third less than Li-cobalt. Figure 3 shows the spider web of a typical Li-manganese battery.\nFigure 3: Snapshot of a typical Li-manganese battery\nModerate in overall performance; newer designs offer improvements in specific power, safety and life span.\nCourtesy of BCG research\nIn 1996, the University of Texas (and other contributors) discovered phosphate as cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. Li-phosphate offers good electrochemical performance with low resistance. This is made possible with nano-scale phosphate cathode material. The key benefits are excellent thermal stability, tolerant to abuse, high current rating and long cycle life. On the negative, the lower voltage of 3.30V/cell reduces the specific energy. Although the flat voltage discharge provides enduring power handling, it complicates state-of-charge measurement. Li-phosphate is not interchangeable with other lithium-based systems; the lower cell voltage requires a different charger setting. Figure 4 summarizes the attributes of Li-phosphate. Typical uses are power tools, electric powertrain and increasingly also large energy storage systems (ESS).\nFigure 4: Snapshot of a typical Li-phosphate battery\nLi-phosphate is one of the most robustLi-ion systems in terms of safety and life span, but offers moderate specific energy (capacity). The low internal resistance keeps the battery cool during high load and fast charge conditions.\nCourtesy of BCG research\nThe NMC uses nickel, manganese and cobalt as cathode material. Nickel is known for its high specific energy but low stability, and manganese forms a spinel structure for low internal resistance but offers limited specific energy. Combining the metals results in a winning formula delivering a specific energy that is equal to Li-cobalt with improved safety and enhanced life span. Figure 5 summarizes these results. NMC batteries are relatively new and are widely used in power tools, power tools and e-bikes.\nFigure 5: Snapshot of NMC\nNMC offers good overall performance with high specific energy, low internal resistance and a moderate price. This is the preferred battery for electric powertrains and industrial applications.\nCourtesy of BCG research\nThe spider webs list only the most basic attributes of a battery and omits other important features, such as toxicity, internal resistance, charge times, charge acceptance at cold temperatures, capacity loss during storage, self-discharge and safety if abused and when getting old.\nAviation has some of the most stringent demands and this causes challenges when introducing new battery chemistries for onboard functions. Let’s look at these conditions in more detail.\nA single safety breach with bad press can turn the public against the incumbent airplane. Two battery incidents on a new airplane hint to a design flaw and Boeing must realize that Li-ion serving as the main battery may not be as well understood as NiCd and lead acid systems.\nExplaining the 2006 recall involving 6 million lithium-ion packs, Sony said that on rare occasions microscopic metal particles may come into contact with other parts in a Li-ion cell, leading to a short circuit. Battery manufacturers try to minimize the presence of such particles but admit that eliminating all metallic dust is nearly impossible. Cells with ultra-thin separators of only 20–25µm are more susceptible to impurities than older designs with lower Ah ratings.\nAccording to a major Lithium-ion battery manufacturer, field failures occur randomly in roughly one of every 4 to 5 million battery cells coming off the production line. Current technologies are nearing their theoretical limit on specific energy using conventional metal oxides and battery manufacturers are improving methods to enhance safety and increase the life span. But the problem persists in that on rare occasions an electrical short can develop inside the cell. This is suspected on the B-787 batteries.\nA mild short only causes elevated self-discharge and the heat buildup is minimal. However, if enough microscopic metallic particles converge on one spot, a sizable current flow can develop with time between the electrodes and the area heats up, causing further damage. An uneven separator can also trigger cell failure. Poor conductivity caused by a dry spot increases resistance, which can generate local heat spots that can weaken the integrity of the separator. When an electrical short occurs, the temperature quickly reaches 500°C (932°F), leading to a thermal runaway. The failed battery on the Boeing 787 is reported to have reached 260°C (500°F), a temperature that induces a thermal runaway.\nDuring a thermal runaway, the elevated heat of the failing cell may propagate to neighboring cells, causing them to become thermally unstable also. This appears to have happened on the Boeing 787 battery. A chain reaction can occur when each cell disintegrates on its own timetable. A Li-ion battery can disintegrate in a few seconds or over several hours as each cell is being consumed on its own accord. To increase safety, batteries should include dividers to protect the failing cell from spreading to the neighboring one. (The Tesla Roadster using Li-cobalt encases each cell in its own metal compartment.)\nA flaming Li-ion battery is difficult to extinguish. Dowsing with water may not be effective and special chemicals are required. If possible, remove the burning battery from flammable materials, place it into the open and use water to cool the surrounding area. This is not possible with a burning aircraft battery and the FAA may require that a Li-ion be allowed to burn out in the aircraft without causing damage. Containing a thermal event would require a fire and explosion-safe battery enclosure and battery manufacturers are working on such models.\nThe question asked is: “When should a battery be replaced to meet the mandated safety?” NiCd batteries in avionics are retired when the capacity drops below a given threshold. Low capacity may also be used to determine the end-of-life of an aging Li-ion, but it is possible that safety concerns require an earlier replacement. Laboratory stress tests may not reveal this accurately, but field use will.\nAs the investigation of the battery fire continues, conspiracies arise of improper wiring, and this is very unlikely. If it were true, the protection circuit would safeguard the battery from possible excess voltage and loading conditions.\nIncorrect charging is another suspect. There is suspect that the Li-ion battery was kept on trickle charge once fully charged. Li-ion cannot absorb overcharge and the charge current must be cut off when fully charged. A continuous trickle charge (maintenance charge) could cause plating of metallic lithium that can lead an electrical short. To reduce stress, Li-ion should dwell slightly below the 100% state-of-charge after a full charge. A recharge can be applied when the charge drops to say 80 to 90%.\nWhen a fault develops in the battery core, as is probable with the two failed B-787 packs, peripheral safety circuits have limited effect; they only protect the battery from outside interference. Once in thermal runaway condition, neither the charger, nor the protection circuit can stop the event; only containment can in the form of a protective battery enclosure.\nLife span reflects cycle count and longevity governed by environment conditions and usage pattern. This includes temperature, depth of discharge and load currents. A shallow discharge is preferred over full cycles, and a slow three-hour charge is better than a rapid charge, but most importantly the battery should be kept cool. Aging manifests itself mainly through capacity loss; capacity is the leading health indicator of most batteries.\nHeat is the enemy of the battery; keeping a Li-ion in a fully charged state adds further stress. The worst condition is retaining a fully charged Li-ion at high temperature. Table 2 estimates the recoverable capacity of lead acid, nickel-based and Li-ion batteries after one year of storage at different temperatures.\nTemperature\nLead acidat full charge\nNickel-basedat any charge\nLithium-ion (Li-cobalt)\n40% charge\n100% charge\n0°C\n25°C\n40°C\n60°C\n97%\n90%\n62%\n38%(after 6 months)\n99%\n97%\n95%\n70%\n98%\n96%\n85%\n75%\n94%\n80%\n65%\n60%(after 3 months)\nTable 2: Estimated recoverable capacity when storing a battery for one year.Elevated temperature hastens permanent capacity loss. Li-ion is also sensitive to charge levels.\nPerformance manifests itself in the delivery of power during blistering summer heat and in freezing temperatures. Li-ion does not perform as well as NiCd at low temperature. While NiCd can accept a slow charge when cold, Li-ion should not be charged below freezing. Fast-charging is only permissible from 5 to 45°C (41 to 113°F). Although Li-ion appears to be charging, a plating of metallic lithium can occur on the anode during cold temperature charging. Batteries affected by cold charging are more vulnerable to failure if exposed to vibration or other stressful conditions. (Some Li-ion cells are made to charge down to –10°C (14°F) but at a reduced rate.)\nSpecific energy demonstrates how much energy a battery can store. Li-ion can hold more energy by weight and size than nickel and lead-based systems, however, Li-ion batteries for aviation (and other industrial applications) are optimized for safety and longevity, not capacity. This reflects in a lower specific energy than enjoyed on consumer products. In addition, the B-787 charges the LVP10 to only 4.025V/cell instead of the traditional 4.20V. This prolongs battery life but reduces the capacity from the specified 100% to about 75%. Li-ion batteries in satellites and electric powertrains use similar practices by avoiding full charges and limiting deep discharges.\nLi-ion does not need deep discharge cycles to reverse memory as NiCd does; however, an occasional deep discharge is advisable as a learn cycle to calibrate the battery management system (BMS). BMS is known to lose accuracy over time.\nSpecific power demonstrates the ability to deliver current for an electrical load. According to Table 1 earlier, Li-cobalt, the battery chosen for the B-787, only handles 1C, while Li-manganese and NMC can deliver discharge currents at 10C and Li-phosphate at 35C; 10 and 35 times higher than their rated Ah. With low internal resistance, these systems run cooler than Li-cobalt.\nThe Cost to manufacture Li-ion batteries is higher than NiCd; the most economical battery is lead acid. Material costs are not the sole reason for the higher cost; complex assembly procedures boost the price. The battery market has predicted lower Li-ion prices but this has not yet materialized. The protection circuit required for all Li-ion to assure safety and longevity adds to the cost further.\nBoeing selected lithium-ion because the battery meets the performance and design objectives of the 787 in providing added electrical function at reduced weight. “Nothing we learned during the design of the 787, or since then, has led us to change our fundamental assessment of the technology,” a company spokesman said. But with the 787 grounded worldwide, Boeing is struggling to understand why its multiple safety systems failed to stop the damage to the battery.\nGiven that the battery serves only as start-and-backup system, which can be neglected when other power sources become available on a running aircraft, an aircraft manufacturer may place more importance on the propulsion system than the battery, but an uncontrollable battery fire is a concern. Here, Li-ion has a disadvantage over the traditional NiCd. All batteries are subject to failure and there is also a reported incident where the battery circuit breaker of a Boeing 777 had to be pulled because of an overheating NiCd battery. In the early 1970s, the National Transportation Safety Board reported several battery incidents per year involving the then new nickel-cadmium, but none let to casualties. A redesign eventually made NiCd safe and it became a standard for airliners.\nWhen Thales, the maker of the electrical system, decided on Li-cobalt for the B-787 battery in 2005, they chose an available system that offered high capacity. Meanwhile more stable chemistries have been developed, and it would have been advisable had Boeing considered one of these technologies before releasing the plane. While Li-manganese, Li-phosphate and NMC can endure internal heat of 200°C (392°F) and higher, Li-cobalt becomes unstable at 150°C (302°F).\nNor did the 2006 fire at Securaplane, the maker of the onboard chargers for the B-787, deter the use of the chosen battery system. A Li-ion exploded during testing and burned the administrative building to the ground. Securaplane, a unit of Britain's Meggitt Plc., said that they will “contribute to the investigation process” by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA, but determined that the battery fire involved prototypes that were not installed in Boeing 787 aircraft. Adding to this concern, a lithium-ion battery also destroyed a Cessna Citation jet on the ground in 2011. Cessna is now very cautious.\nThere is the option to go back to NiCd, and the wide-body, long-range Airbus 350 in development by European aircraft manufacturer Airbus may do that. It will require a different charging system and a modified BMS. In addition, the lower specific energy of NiCd will double the battery numbers and weight, but the Airbus 350 is said to be less dependent on electric power than the Dreamliner.\nLithium-ion batteries have not yet matured and it is advisable that aircraft manufacturers design planes that allow updating to more advanced technologies as better batteries become available. Now a retro-fit on the Boeing 787 is said to take two years. More flexible designs would allow moving with the time.\nAircraft are pressurized to an altitude of 6,000 feet (1830 meters) and thinner air may affect Li-ion batteries differently than at sea levels. In addition, large-format Li-ion batteries have added mechanical strain compared to smaller packs. Battery diagnostics has not advanced as rapidly as other technologies and hidden anomalies can often go undetected until a disassembly develops. Cadex Electronics has made critical progress in these areas but more development will be needed.\nBattery testing is complex and no single measurement can capture all irregularities. As a doctor is trained to use a wide selection of medical instruments to diagnose an illness, so also does a battery need different technologies to detect anomalies that can develop. While a fading battery on a mobile phone simply becomes a nuisance to the user, a malfunctioning aviation battery can have serious consequences.\nReferences:\nNational Transportation Safety Board presentation “Investigative Update of Battery fire Japan Airlines B-787 – Jan 7, 2013 by Deborah A.P.

        "content": "Governments are asking the public to reduce fuel consumption and lower pollution. They do this without imposing a change in driving habits and the HEV fits the bill. Japan is leading in adapting the HEV because of high fuel costs and environmental concerns.\nThe purpose of the HEV is to conserve fuel without sacrificing performance, and the HEV achieves this by using one or several electric motor to assist the ICE during acceleration and to harness kinetic energy when braking. The ICE turns off at traffic lights and the electric motor propels the car through slow-moving traffic. On full power, both the ICE and electric motor engage for optimal acceleration.\nThe HEV uses a mechanical powertrain to transfer power from the ICE to the wheels. In this respect, the HEV resembles an ordinary vehicle with a crankshaft and a clutch, also known as parallel configuration. Fuel savings are achieved by the use of a smaller ICE that is tuned for maximum fuel efficiency rather than high torque. Toyota claims a thermal efficiency of 40 percent for the new Prius. Peppy driving is accredited to the electric motor as this propulsion system delivers far better torque than a sluggish ICE of the same horsepower. Figure 1 illustrates the different modes of an electrified powertrain in in an HEV.\nBattery power is only used for short durations. The HEV battery seldom encounters full charge-discharge cycles that are common in the electric vehicle.\nMost batteries for HEVs are guaranteed for 8 years. To meet this long service life, the cells are optimized for longevity rather than high specific energy as with consumer products. The battery maker achieves this in part by using a thicker and more durable separator. To reduce stress, the battery operates at 30–80 percent state-of-charge (SoC), or roughly 3.5–4.0V/cell for Li-ion, rather than the customary 3.0–4.20V/cell.\nHEV batteries operate momentarily and share similarity with a starter battery by applying short power bursts for acceleration rather than long, continuous discharges as with the EV. Rarely will an HEV battery discharge to a low 20 percent state-of-charge (SoC). Under normal use, a parallel HEV consumes less than 2 percent of the available battery capacity per mile (1.6km). Capacity fade goes unnoticed, and an HEV battery still works well with less than half the original capacity.\nFigure 2 shows the battery capacity of six hybrid cars at a 256,000km (160,000 miles). The test was done by the US Department of Energy’s FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program (FCVT) in 2006 according to SAE J1634 practices and it included the Honda Civic, Honda Insight and Toyota Prius.\nAt 256,000km (160,000 miles), the two Honda Civic vehicles had 68% capacity, the Insight had 85% and the Prius had 39%. The capacity fade did not affect the fuel efficiency\nThe hybrid battery of the two Honda Civic vehicles had 68 percent remaining capacity; the Insight had 85 percent and the Prius 39 percent. Even with lower capacity at the end of life, the fuel efficiency was not severely affected. The Insight showed a 1.2mpg (0.12L/km) decrease in fuel economy during the test, while the Prius reduced the fuel efficiency by 3.2mpg (0.33L/km). Air-conditioning was off in both cases.\nStringent battery demands are needed for hybrid trucks with a gross vehicle weight of 33 tons (73,000 lb). The battery must be able to continuously charge and discharge at 4C, deliver 10kW (200hp) for up to 10 minutes, operate at –20°C to 40°C (–4°F to 104°F) and deliver 5 years of service. Supercapacitors would provide the required durability but high cost and low energy density are against this choice. Lead acid has good discharge characteristics but it is slow to charge. Li-ion, especially LTO, would be a good choice but high power draw requires active cooling. Second generation NiMH is being tested; the rugged NiCd may also be tried.\nAs good as a hybrid may be, the car is not without ironies. At a conference addressing advanced automotive batteries, an HEV opponent argued with an HEV maker that a diesel car offers better fuel economy than a hybrid. Being a good salesman, the HEV maker flatly denied the claim. Perhaps both are right. In city driving, the HEV clearly delivers better fuel-efficiency while diesel consumes less on the highway. Combining both would provide the best solution, but the high cost of a diesel-hybrid solution might not pay back with low fuel prices, although such vehicles are available in Europe.\nHigh-end HEVs come with a full-sized ICE of 250hp and an electrical motor of 150–400hp in total. Such vehicles will surely find buyers, especially if the government assists with grants for being “green.” It’s unfortunate that consumers who walk, cycle or take public transportation won’t get such handouts. Common sense reminds us to conserve energy by driving less, or using smaller vehicles when driving is necessary.\nWolfgang Hatz, the then head of powertrain for Volkswagen Group, said that hybrid technology is a very expensive way to save a small amount of fuel and states that Volkswagen only makes hybrids because of political pressure. He supports diesel as the most energy-efficient motor, especially on highways.\nVolkswagen may have a solution — the 1-Liter Car (Figure 3). It is called the 1-Liter Car because the concept vehicle burns only one liter of fuel per 100km. To prove the concept, the then VW chairman Dr. Ferdinand Piëch drove the car from their headquarters in Wolfsburg to Hamburg for a shareholders meeting. The average consumption was just 0.89 liters per 100km (317mpg).\nThe 1-Liter Car is said to be the most economical car in the world but it never made it into production.\nAerodynamics and weight help to achieve the low fuel consumption. While a typical car has a drag coefficient of 0.30, the 1-Liter Car is only 0.16. Carbon fiber and a magnesium frame reduce the weight to 290kg (640lb). The one-cylinder diesel engine generates 8.5hp (6.3kW), and the 6.5-litre (1.43-gallon) fuel tank has a range of 650 kilometers (400 miles). The average fuel consumption is 0.99 liter per 100km (238mpg).\nAlthough the 1-Liter Car did not go into production, VW demonstrated that fossil fuel could be stretched should the cost rise or should frivolous consumption create unsustainably high pollution levels. Point-to-point personal transportation could be made possible with a light carrier that weighs only 290kg, a weight that is less than the 540kg Tesla S battery. Rather than consuming 150–250Wh per kilometer, as with an electric vehicle, the 1-Liter Car would only use about 40Wh/km. Even though it burns fossil fuel, the environmental impact would be less than an EV propelled with electricity, which is mainly produced by fossil fuel.\nMost PHEVs use a fully electrified powertrain in a series configuration with no mechanical linkage from ICE to wheels. The system runs solely on the electric motor for propulsion, and the ICE only engages when the batteries get low to supply electricity for the electric motor and to charge the battery. The driving range of a fully charged battery is about 50km (30 miles).\nThe PHEV is ideal for commuting and doing errands. No gasoline is consumed when driving on batteries and the highways are tax-free. However, there will be an increase in the electrical utility bill to charge the batteries at home.\nUnlike the parallel HEV that relies on the battery for only brief moments, the PHEV battery is in charge depletion mode, meaning that the battery must work harder than on an HEV. This adds to battery stress and reduces longevity. While a capacity drop to 39 percent will affect the performance of the Toyota Prius HEV only marginally, such a loss would reduce the electric driving range of a PHEV from 50km to 20km (30 to 12 miles).\nThe Chevy Volt carries a 16kWh Li-ion battery that weighs 181kg (400 lb) and powers a 149hp (111kW) electric motor. The temperature of the prismatic cells is kept at 20–25C (68–77F) during charging and driving. An 115VAC outlet fills the battery in 8 hours; a 230VAC reduces the charging time to 3 hours. The driving range is 64km (40 miles) before the 1.4-liter four-cylinder ICE kicks in to activate the 53kW AC generator that powers the electric motors.\nAs good as the PHEV sounds, the long-term savings may be smaller than expected, especially if a battery replacement is needed during the life of the car. Battery aging is an issue that car makers avoid mentioning in fear of turning buyers away. A motorist used to driving ICE cars expects ample power at hot and cold temperatures and minimal performance degradation with age. The battery cannot match this fully, and the owner will need to tolerate a decrease in driving range during the winter, as well as accept a small reduction in delivered mileage with each advancing year due to battery aging.\nModern cars do more than provide transportation; they also include amenities for safety, comfort and pleasure. The most basic of these are the headlights and windshield wipers. Buyers also want cabin heat and air-conditioning, services that are taken for granted in a vehicle that burns fossil fuel. Heat is a by-product in the ICE that must be generated with battery power in a PHEV, but the larger concern is air-conditioning, which draws 3–5kW of power. Comforts might need to be provided more sparingly when running on a battery.\nMany PHEV buyers value the environmental benefit and the pleasure of driving a quiet vehicle powered by electricity. This has a large buyer appeal because electric propulsion is more natural than that of an ICE. Drivers must adapt to the new lifestyle of charging the vehicle at night when electricity is cheap and then driving measured distances. Users of these cars will also appreciate new charging stations at workplaces and shopping malls.\n[1] Source: RWTH Aachen University, Germany[2] Source: FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program[3] Source: Volkswagen AG\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "A battery resembles a living organism that cannot be measured; only estimated by diagnostics similar to a doctor examining a patient. The accuracy of rapid-testing varies according to symptoms. These indicators change with state-of-charge (SoC), agitation after charge and discharge, temperature and length of storage. A rapid-test must have the ability to distinguish between a good battery that is partially charged and a weak pack that is fully charged. Both variants deliver similar runtimes in the hands of the user but have different performance levels.\nA widely used performance analysis is coulomb counting in which in-and-out-flowing energies are measured. Coulomb counting goes back 250 years when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb first established the “Coulomb Rule.” Elegant in concept, but coulomb counting has its own problem in that it loses accuracy when the battery is randomly charged and discharged. State-of-health (SoH) estimation by a digital solution is incomplete without also including the chemical battery.\nThe leading health indicator of a battery is capacity. Capacity represents energy storage, a quality that gradually and permanently fades with use. Other characteristics responsible for SoH are internal resistance that governs load current and self-discharge that examines mechanical integrity. All three characteristics must be met to give a battery a clean bill of health.\nEstimating the capacity of the chemical battery on the fly is most complex. This involves algorithms and matrices that serve as lookup tables similar to letter or face recognition. Modern rapid-test methods move towards advanced machine learning in capturing the many moods of a battery.\nHere is a summary of simple to complex test methods to examine batteries.\nNo single test can capture all health indicators of a battery. Many rapid-test devices look only at voltage and internal resistance. While capacity loss of a fading NiCd or NiMH may correlate with rising internal resistance, this relationship is less evident with lithium- and lead-based batteries. Advertising capacity estimation with a tester that only measures voltage and internal resistance can be misleading. It confuses the industry into believing that complex results are attainable with simplistic methods. Resistance-based instruments will indeed identify a dying or dead battery; but so does the user.\nA battery is a reactive device and the method by which resistance measurements are taken matters. A DC measurement looks at pure resistive values while AC includes reactive components that provide additional information. Figure 1 represents the impedance of a good and faded Li-ion battery when scanned with AC from 0.1Hz to 1kHz. The strongest variances in impedance (-Imp -Z) are observed on the low frequency scale ranging between 1Hz and 10Hz.\nImpedance variances are most visible below 10Hz. The horizontal scale is logarithmic to condense the frequency range.Source: Cadex ElectronicsIt should be noted that resistive readings alone are inconclusive. No size fits all and the signatures vary with battery size and type. The results are further skewed by SoC levels, agitation and temperature. Cadex laboratories further discovered differences in how batteries are aged. What is most puzzling is why natural aging produces dissimilar signatures than artificial aging done in environmental chambers with fixed test regimes. This human-like behavior shares similarities with longevities people experience living in different global regions.\nCadex is pioneering in several rapid-test methods. These are Quick-sort Model Specific, Electrochemical Dynamic Response and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).\nQSMS observes difference in resistive values when assessing a battery with DC and AC methods. For example, the resistance of Li-ion in an 18650 cell is about 110mOhm with DC measurement and roughly 36mOhm with a 1,000Hz AC signal. The variance between the two readings provides performance information when compared with battery-specific parameters that are stored in a lookup table.\nThe algorithm is relatively simple and the test time is short, but the logistics of creating the parameters derived from good, marginal and poor batteries adds to complexity. QSMS is one of several rapid-test methods that Cadex has developed to classify mobile phone batteries on the fly.\nEDR measures the mobility of ion-flow between electrodes by applying load pulses and evaluating the response time on attack and recovery. The recovery times are compared with stored parameters relating to battery performance. Figure 2 demonstrates a good battery that is firm and has a quick recovery against a weak battery that shows softness and has a sluggish recovery.\nEDR measures the ion flow between the positive and negative plates. A strong battery recovers quickly from an attack whereas a weaker pack is more sluggish. U.S. Patent 7,622,929. Source: Cadex Electronics\nThe diffusion coefficient of Li-ion differs according to active material and electrolyte additives used. EDR was developed by Cadex to rapid-test a broad range of mobile phone batteries. The technology is now being developed to test larger batteries.\nEIS moves rapid-testing to a higher complexity level by scanning a battery with multiple frequencies to generate a Nyquist plot. The Nyquist information is then superimposed onto electrochemical models that enable the estimation of capacity, CCA and SoC non-invasively. The typical test time is 15 seconds.\nThe Nyquist plot is named after Harry Nyquist (1889–1976), a former engineer at Bell Laboratories. It presents the frequency response of a linear system by displaying both amplitude and phase angle on a single plot using frequency as parameter. The horizontal x axis reveals the real Ohm impedance while the vertical y axis represents the imaginary impedance. Scientists predict that battery diagnostics is gravitating toward EIS technology by combining test results with complex modeling.\nFigure 3 illustrates the three domains of the Nyquist plot entitled migration on the high frequency end, charge transfer in mid-range, and diffusion on the low frequency scale.\nThe mid-frequency semi-circle represents battery characteristics best. Larger batteries require lower frequencies.Source: Cadex\nWhen scanning a battery from kilohertz to millihertz, the Migration field reveals resistive qualities of a battery that represents a bird’s-eye view of the landscape. Valuable characteristics are found in the mid frequency range called Charge Transfer. This all-important domain forms a semi-circle representing the kinetics of the battery that provide SoH references. The low range dubbed Diffusion includes additional information relating to capacity but this requires long test times. Battery size directs the frequency; the larger the battery in ampere-hours, the lower the applied frequency becomes.\nA rapid-test should last from a few seconds to no more than 5 minutes, but applying ultra-low frequencies prolongs time. For example, at one millihertz (mHz), one cycle takes 1,000 seconds, or 16 minutes, and several data points are required to complete the analysis. Test durations can often be shortened with clever software simulation.\nNyquist analysis is well suited to test lithium- and lead-based batteries. The multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, or Spectro™ by Cadex, is the first EIS-based application that estimates battery capacity. Capacity is the leading health indicator; CCA of a starter battery refers to the internal battery resistance that is responsible for engine cranking. In a well-maintained battery, CCA stays high while the capacity gradually decreases with use. A ‘no-start’ occurs when the capacity drops below a required capacity level to crank the engine. To eliminate surprises, a starter battery should be replaced when the capacity drops to 40 percent. The benefit of capacity estimation also becomes clear in this application.\nThe term “parser” has been in use in computer technology to describe receiving and sorting instructional data. Cadex uses this term to define battery capacity by establishing the precise SoC with a proprietary algorithm (patent pending) and then counting the coulombs that “fill” the available space of the battery. The charge period must be long enough to attain good readings. Lab results at Cadex show higher capacity accuracies with the battery parser than what is typical with uncalibrated coulomb counting of a smart battery.\nThe battery parser uses advanced machine learning, algorithms that will make its way into modern battery chargers to provide quality control in batteries. This integration will promote the charger into a supervisory system with no added logistics and little extra cost. Diagnostic battery chargers make battery performance transparent by removing the “black box” syndrome, a problem that has haunted battery users for centuries.\nNo rapid-test can evaluate all battery symptoms. There will always be outliers to defy the test protocols. Correct predictions for batteries in service should be 9 out of 10. Outliers may include batteries that are new and have not been fully formatted, or packs that have been in storage. Low SoC also causes errors.\nCapacity is the gate keeper of battery health that relates to runtime and predicts end-of-life. The term capacity is poorly understood. A battery is typically replaced when the capacity fades to 80 percent. When choosing the end-of-life thresholds, an organization should ensure that the lowest performing battery can perform the assigned duty. Revealing capacity estimation by rapid-testing or in a charger will change the way batteries are maintained. These advances will ultimately usher in an industrial revolution in batteries.\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/what-causes-lithium-ion-to-die",
        "content": "Taking performance snapshots in weeks instead of years\nA speaker at the BATTERIES 2013 conference in Nice, France, flashed charts on the screen that showed continuously rising energy densities. When the audience asked the presenter: “Do you believe in these predictions?” the self-conscious speaker replied in a strong Chinese accent, “no.” A subdued laugher arose. The battery industry does not foresee significant improvements in energy density in the near future.\nAfter the 2008 callback when Li-ion disassembled in consumer products, safety gained added attention and batteries became safer. With the advent of the electric vehicle, longevity is moving to the forefront and experts begin exploring what causes batteries to fail. While a two-to-three year battery life with 500 cycles is acceptable for laptops and mobile phones, the eight-year warranty of an EV appears short when considering that a replacement battery carries the price of a new compact car. If the life of the battery could be extended to, say, 20 years, then driving an EV would be justified even if the initial investment is high. Driving a fancy EV, such as the Tesla Model-S, may be more novelty than utility.In October 2012, Leaf owners in California and Arizona sued Nissan, claiming that the vehicles have a design defect that causes them to prematurely lose battery life and driving range. Heat when driving in a hot climate was blamed. The battery in the Leaf has no active thermal management to keep the cells cool. This omission was given as the reason why the battery would lose 27.5 percent of its capacity after one-to-two years of ownership.EV manufacturers choose battery systems very carefully. The selection begins by picking cells that are optimized for longevity rather than high specific energy. Batteries deployed for industrial applications are normally larger and heavier than those used in consumer goods for the same ampere/hour.Nissan selected a manganese-based Li-ion because of good performance. Batteries must go through strenuous life cycle testing and to beat the clock, the test protocol often mandates a rapid charge of 1.5 C (less than one hour) and a discharge of 2.5C (20 minutes) under a soaring temperature of 60°C (140°F). Even under these conditions, the battery may lose only 10 percent after 500 cycles, which represents one to two years of driving. This would emulate driving an EV through the heat of a biblical hell, leaving rubber marks for aggressive driving, and still come out with a battery boasting 90 percent capacity. Why then would the Leaf under more reasonable conditions drop the capacity by so much?Field failures only come to light after the product had been in use for a few years. Professor Jeff Dahn at Dalhousie University knows this and together with his colleagues developed coulombic efficiency (CE), a method that defines the efficiency with which electrons are transferred in an electrochemical system.During charge, lithium gravitates to the graphite anode (negative electrode) and the voltage potential changes. Removing the lithium again during discharge does not reset the battery fully. A film consisting of lithium atoms forms on the surface of the anode called solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Composed of lithium oxide and lithium carbonate, the SEI layer grows as the battery cycles. The film gets thicker and eventually forms a barrier that obstructs interaction with graphite.The cathode (positive electrode) develops a similar restrictive layer known as electrolyte oxidation. Dr. Dahn stresses that a voltage above 4.10V/cell at high heat causes this, a demise that can be more harmful than cycling. The longer the battery stays in this condition, the worse the degradation gets. The build-up can result in a sudden capacity loss that is difficult to predict by cycling alone. This phenomenon had been known for some years but measuring the coulombic efficiency can verify these effects in a more scientific and systematic manner.CE measures both changes: the lithium lost due to SEI growth on the anode and electrolyte oxidation at the cathode. The results can be used to rank the life expectancy of a battery by quantifying the parasitic reaction. The CE of a perfect battery would be 1.000,000. If this were the case, Dr. Dahn says, the Li-ion battery would last for ever. An excellent coulombic efficiency is 0.9999, a level some LCO (Lithium Cobalt Oxide2) reach. By far the best Li-ion batteries in terms of CE are those using Lithium Titanate (LTO) as anodes. They have the potential of delivering 10,000 cycles. The negatives are high cost and reduced specific energy.CE readings vary with temperature and charge rate, also known as C-rate. As the cycle time gets longer, self-discharge comes into effect and CE drops (gets worse). Electrolyte oxidation at the cathode causes self-discharge. Li-ion loses about two percent per month at 0C (32F) and half-charge; up to 35 percent at 60C (140F) when fully charged. Table 1 provides data of the most common Li-ion system. CE is described as excellent, good moderate and poor taken at 30°C (86°F).\nHigh capacity, high power, tolerant to abuse.\nPower tools, e-bikes, EV, medical, UPS\nTable 1: Most commonly used Li-ion with Coulombinc Efficiency rated in excellent, good, moderate and poor. Battery manufacturers may one day specify CE in a number.\n1 Taken at C/20 and 30°C (86°F). (20h charge & discharge); 2 Cathode material; 3 Anode material\nLithium-ion has improved and credit goes to electrolyte additives. Each cell has several additives and manufacturers keep the combinations a secret. Additives lower internal resistance by reducing corrosion, decrease gassing, speed up manufacturing by fine-tuning the wetting process, and improve low and high temperature performance. Adding 1–2 percent Vinylene Carbonate improves SEI on the anode, limits electrolyte oxidation at the cathode and enhances the CE readings. Other additives provide added benefits and one asks: “Can these chemicals interact with each other?” As a patient taking multiple medications must inform the doctor before additional pills can be prescribed, similar conditions may also exist with batteries. CE discovers possible interference in weeks rather than having to wait for years for symptoms to develop.\nTo examine the correlation between CE and longevity, Dalhousie works with battery manufacturers, including E-One Moli in Vancouver. The test bed consisted of 160 cells, four of each type. E-One Moli provided 80 cells with their own secret sauce; Dalhousie specified the other 80 electrolyte samples. All ingredients were carefully documented, except those provided by the cell manufacturer; these are kept as a top secret.\nDalhousie identified five batteries of interest. Table 2 shows the CE of these five samples with values ranging from 0.9960 to 0.9995; Table 3 demonstrates the test results when cycled to death. To Dalhousie’s anticipation and satisfaction, CE harmonized well with the cycle count. Batteries with high CE lasted the longest; those with low CE values were the first to die.\nTable 3: Relationship with Coulombinc Efficiency and cycle life. High CE values live the longest, low values die first.\nCourtesy of the Dalhousie University\nBattery wear-and-tear also includes structural degradation that can be captured with traditional cycle testing. Dr. Dahn calls this type of testing the “sausage machine.” While measuring coulombic efficiency, in which Dalhousie is leading, helps in the development of batteries by giving a snapshot assessment of additives; the old sausage machine does the verification thereafter. Figure 4 demonstrates capacity loss caused by the structural degradation of an older Li-ion when cycled at a 1C, 2C and 3C. The rapid loss of capacity at higher C-rates may be lithium planting at the anode due to rapid charging.\nDalhousie’s coulombinc efficiency has gained the interest of device manufacturers, including healthcare and makers of EVs. Tesla cars use the 18650 because the cell is readily available at a low price. This was an unlike choice for the Tesla Roadster, the first EV by Tesla, as the cell was designed to power cameras, laptops, consumer products, medical devices and e-bikes. Perhaps unknown to Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla Motor, cobalt-based lithium-ion has a high (good) CE reading that adds to longevity if used carefully, the lack of robustness was solved by oversizing the pack.Today, the Tesla Model-S uses Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide (NCA), a chemistry that has high specific energy, high specific power and a long cycle count, but it costs a bit more. Tesla is also super-sizing the NCA to reduce stress. The batteries of the Model S-60 and S-85 are so large that they can operate at a C-rate of only 0.25C (C/4), even at highway speed. This allows Tesla to focus on high energy density for maximum runtime and longevity; power density is less important. The negative is increased energy consumption due to a heavier vehicle and a higher battery price. The manganese-based Li-ion batteries of the Nissan Leaf have excellent lab result but what may have been overlooked is the damage done when keeping the battery at high voltage and high temperature. As the CE tests reveal, these two conditions can cause more damage than mere cycling, especially with LMO (Lithium Manganese Oxide2). The NMC (Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide2) is better and only shows a worsening CE performance above 50°C (123°F). The good news is that the Leaf battery is robust and will perform well in most parts of the world.Henrik Fisker chose LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate2) by A123, also a robust system when cycled in the laboratory but it has less favorable CE readings when operated above 50°C (123°F). While the demand for the Tesla Model-S exceeds production capability, the equally stunning Fisker sports car is no longer produced.A successful EV market will eventually replace the 18650 with a larger format prismatic or pouch cell. The price per kWh will drop and the advantage of the 18650 will varnish. Good performance, high volume and multi-sourcing made the 18650 a frontrunner in lithium-ion.SummaryThe four suspected renegades that are responsible for capacity loss and the eventual end-of-life of the Li-ion battery are:\nPrice and longevity will dictate how far the battery can go and the EV sets the upper boundary. With current technologies, deploying batteries for trains, ships and airplanes makes little sense. Competing against mighty oil with a net calorific value that is 100 times higher than that of the battery is tough. Conversely, petroleum cannot touch the battery that is clean, quiet, small, and provides an immediate startup with the flick of a switch. Incremental battery improvements will eventually secure more of what is so strongly entrenched in the seemingly endless flow of cheap fossil fuel.\nReferencesWith thank Dr. Jeff Dahn, Professor of Physics and Chemistry, Dalhousie University for his editing efforts.

        "title": "Will Secondary Batteries replace Primaries?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/will-secondary-batteries-replace-primaries",
        "content": "Consumer market put aside, the largest users of primary (non-rechargeable) batteries are the military, specialty emergency services and forest fire fighters. High energy density, long storage and operational readiness are among their strong attributes. No charging and priming is required before use. Logistic is simple and battery power can be made available at remote locations that are unmanned and have no electrical power. Disposal is easy because most primary cells contain little toxic materials.Primary batteries have the highest energy density. Although the secondary (rechargeable) batteries have improved, a regular household alkaline provides 50% more power than lithium-ion, one of the highest energy-dense secondary batteries. The primary lithium battery used in cameras holds more than three times the energy of a lithium-ion battery of same size.\nThe negative on the primary batteries is its relative high internal resistance, which inhibits current flow. High internal resistance has little affect when powering low-current devices such as a TV remote control or a kitchen clock. The problem arises with digital cameras and other power-hungry devices. A power drill on an alkaline would be unthinkable. The voltage would imply collapse.The comparison of the energy densities was done in an unfair way. Whereas most secondary batteries are rated at a 1C discharge, the alkaline was discharged at only 25mA to 0.8 volts. We now take the same batteries and run them under a load. The yellow bars in Figure 2 represent the usable energy if the batteries were used in such a device as a digital camera.\nCapacity rating of alkaline cellsWith moderate load, the energy density of alkaline batteries is very high. Figure 3 illustrates the rated capacities of the AAA, AA, C, D cells and the 9V pack. Note that these batteries only deliver the specified mAh if discharged through a high resistive load typical of portable entertainment devices.\nFigure 3: Industrial Alkaline Battery specifications (Courtesy of Panasonic). * The mAh ratings are for reference only. The actual ratings may vary depending on discharge rate\nThe most distinct limitation of the primary battery is its one-time use. Because of this, the cost of power is about 30 times higher than that of rechargeables. The pricing becomes even more excessive if the packs are replaced after each mission, regardless of length. A general of the US Army said that half of the batteries discarded still have 50% energy left. Throwing away partially used batteries is widespread. Keeping track of these packs in the military and public sector is time-consuming and awkward. It is much simpler to issue fresh packs before each activity.It is possible to read the state-of-charge of primary batteries. The most basic method is measuring the open terminal voltage but the result is inaccurate. The increase in internal resistance with lower state-of-charge adds to run-time estimations. A better method is counting the out-flowing energy units, also known as coulombs. This requires a circuit and a display unit on the battery. Due to high cost and inherent inaccuracies, especially during pulsed loading, this method is seldom used on primary batteries. A more accurate state-of-charge measurement is possible with a rapid-test instrument that examines the chemical integrity of the battery. The test is non-invasive and takes only a few seconds to complete.\nDuring the last ten years, armies and emergency response teams have gradually been switching to rechargeable batteries. Improvements in battery technology, better charge methods and more readily available power sources made this possible. The most important single reason, however, is cost. In the US Army, rechargeable batteries are being used predominately for training. Officials are now exploring their suitability for combat missions. Rechargeables have advantages that go beyond cost issues. For one, the batteries can be re-used and do not burden the supply channels. In the absence of electric power, charging can be done through solar power, windmills and hand-crank generators. Even kinetic power is being explored in which an electric generator is built in the sole of the soldier's boot. Rechargeable batteries are able to providing power when no supply of fresh batteries is possible. Another advantage of secondary batteries is low internal resistance. This allows high current on demand, an attribute that is essential for digital devices and instruments needing high inrush currents. Power tools, for example, could not be run effectively on alkaline batteries.But rechargeable batteries have their limitations. Beside marginal energy density, secondary batteries have a defined shelf life and lose the ability to hold charge as they age. Similar to a spring under tension, a secondary battery seeks to revert back to its lowest denominator.Battery aging is subject to cycling, storage temperature and state-of-charge. While a primary battery has a shelf life of 10 years, lithium-based batteries are good for 2-3 years in normal use. Cool storage at a 40% charge level prolongs longevity. Nickel-based batteries are good for 5 years and longer but require priming to regain performance after long storage.Another negative of rechargeable batteries is the high self-discharge. nickel-based batteries exhibit a 10-20% self-discharge per month. This compares with 5-10% for lithium and lead-based batteries. The self-discharge increases at higher temperatures. For this reason, secondary batteries are not an effective media for long-term energy storage; primary batteries are better suited. A secondary battery can never be removed too far from the charger. It needs to be fed before each activity.Secondary batteries have a limited cycle count. The number of cycles achieved is based on the depth of discharge, environmental conditions, charge methods and maintenance procedures. Each battery chemistry behaves differently in terms of aging and wear. Secondary batteries need some level of battery maintenance. Only if periodically discharged do nickel-based batteries provide the cost-effective and reliable service expected in a fleet environment. The deep discharge reverses the crystalline formation (memory) that occurs if a nickel-based battery is repeatedly charged on top of a residual charge. lithium and lead-based batteries have no memory and an occasional discharge is applied to verify performance. Battery maintenance is best done with a battery analyzer.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/the-battery-and-the-digital-load",
        "content": "With the move from analog to digital devices, new demands are being placed on the battery. Unlike analog equipment that draws a predictable and steady current, digital devices load the battery with short, high current bursts.\nOne of the urgent requirements of a battery for digital applications is low internal resistance. Measured in milliohms (mΩ), the internal resistance is the gatekeeper that, to a large extent, determines the runtime. The lower the resistance, the less restriction the battery encounters in delivering the needed power bursts. A high mΩ reading can trigger an early ‘low battery’ indication on a seemingly good battery because the available energy cannot be fully delivered.\nIn this article we examine the current requirements of analog and digital communications devices. Figure 1 provides typical examples of peak current of the analog two-way and digital Tetra radio, as well as the AMP, GSM, TDMA and CDMA mobile phones.\nFigure 1: Peak power requirements of popular global mobile phone systems.Moving from analog to digital equipment reduces the overall energy need but increases the peak current during load pulses. The wattage varies with signal strength.\nService technicians have been puzzled by the seemingly unpredictable battery behavior when powering digital equipment. With the switch from analog to digital wireless communications devices, particularly mobile communications equipment, a battery that performs well on an analog system may show irrational behavior when used on a digital unit. Testing these batteries with a battery analyzer produces good capacity readings. Why then do some batteries fail on digital devices but not on analog?\nThe overall energy requirement of a digital mobile phone is less than that of the analog equivalent, however, the battery must be capable of delivering high current pulses that are often several times that of the battery’s rating. Let’s look at the battery rating as expressed in C‑rates.\nA 1C discharge of a battery rated at 500mAh is 500mA. In comparison, a 2C discharge of the same battery is 1000mA. A GSM phone powered by a 500mA battery that draws 1.5A pulses loads the battery with a whopping 3C discharge.\nA 3C rate discharge is acceptable for a battery with very low internal resistance. However, aging batteries, especially Li‑ion and NiMH chemistries, pose a challenge because the mΩ readings increase with use. Improved performance can be achieved by using a larger battery, also known as an extended pack. Somewhat bulkier and heavier, an extended pack offers a typical rating of about 1000mAh or roughly double that of the slim-line. In terms of C‑rate, the 3C discharge is reduced to 1.5C when using a 1000mAh instead of a 500mAh battery.\nAs part of ongoing research to find the best battery system for wireless devices, Cadex has performed life cycle tests on various battery systems. In Figures 2 to 4 we examine NiCd, NiMH and Li‑ion batteries, each of which generate a good capacity reading when tested with a battery analyzer but produce stunning differences on a pulsed discharge of 1C, 2C and 3C. These pulses simulate a GSM phone.\nA closer look reveals vast discrepancies in the mΩ measurements of the test batteries. In fact, these readings are typical of batteries that have been in use for a while. The NiCd shows 155mΩ, the NiMH 778mΩ and the Li‑ion 320mΩ, although the capacities checked in at 113, 107 and 94 percent respectively when tested with the DC load of a battery analyzer. It should be noted that the internal resistance of a new battery reads between 75 to 150mΩ.\nFrom these charts we observe that the talk-time is in close relationship with the battery’s internal resistance. The NiCd produces a long talk time at all C-rates. In comparison, the NiMH only works at a lower C-rate. The Li‑ion performs better but is marginally at a 3C discharge.\nFigure 2: Talk-time of a NiCd battery under the GSM load schedule. This battery has 113% capacity and 155mΩ internal resistance.\nFigure 3: Talk-time of a NiMH battery under the GSM load schedule.This battery has 107% capacity and 778mΩ internal resistance.\nFigure 4: Talk-time of a Li‑ion battery under the GSM load schedule. This battery has 94% capacity and 320mΩ internal resistance.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-803b: What causes Cells to Short?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-803b-what-causes-cells-to-short",
        "content": "Manufacturers are at a loss to explain why some cells develop high electrical leakage or a short while still new. The culprit might be foreign particles that contaminate the cells during fabrication, or rough-spots on the plates that damage the delicate separator. Clean rooms, improved quality control at the raw material level and minimal human handling during the manufacturing process have reduced the “mortality rate.”\nApplying momentary high-current bursts to evaporate a short in a NiCd or NiMH cell has been tried, but this offers limited success. The short may temporarily vanish, but the damage in the separator remains. The repaired cell may begin to charge normally and reach the correct voltage, but high self-discharge will likely drain the battery quickly and the short will return.\nIt is not advised to replace a shorted cell in an aging pack as the new cells will always be stronger than the others. Consider the biblical verse, “No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.” (Mark 2:21) Replacing faulty cells often leads to battery failures within 6 months. It’s best not to disturb the cells but allow them to age naturally as an intact family. The exception is replacing a defective cell to salvage a well-functioning pack(See BU-302: Series and Parallel Battery Configurations also BU-910: How to Repair a Battery Pack)\nCobalt-blended Li-ion cells develop fewer leak and electrical shorts than nickel- and lead-based batteries but they can occur, especially with Li-phosphate. For unknown reasons, the cell at the positive end in a string is most likely to short first. Perhaps it gets the most stress while the middle cells enjoy some protection by being buffered.\nThe mandatory protection circuit for Li-ion packs can only shield the cell from over-voltage, excessive loading and reverse polarity. An electrical short caused by internal cell damage lies outside the safeguard of the protection circuit. Most cell failures occur when the battery has been damaged by shock and vibration, or has been overcharged or overheated. Charging at freezing temperatures can also damage Li-ion without indication of stress to the user. The Sony recall in 2006, when microscopic metal particles came into contact with other parts and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner that called for a redesign of the battery system are examples of when an internal short could not be prevented by a protection circuit. These were certified Li-ion batteries that developed an electrical short during service(See BU-304a: Safety Concerns with Li-ion)\nTo reduce the risk of an electrical short, Li-ion cells for electric powertrains and demanding industrial applications use a heavy-duty separator. These batteries are larger than those used in consumer products and also have a lower specific energy. Saying that Li-ion has twice the energy density of NiMH can inaccurate. Long-lasting Li-ion cells can have a specific energy as low as 60Wh/kg, which is similar to nickel-cadmium, while some consumer Li-ion can go up to 250Wh/kg.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/teslas-iphone-moment-how-the-powerwall-will-change-global-energy-use",
        "content": "The Tesla battery that Elon Musk announced gets much media attention, and rightly so. The Powerwall, as the Tesla battery is called, can store energy from renewable sources from solar panels and wind turbines to supplement energy needs and reduce the electrical bill. Said Musk, “Our goal is to fundamentally change the way the world uses energy.” This is a noble endeavor at a time when humanity draws more resources than our mother earth can give.The Tesla battery stores energy during peak production when output is in over-supply to bridge the gap when free energy goes to rest. The Powerwall also softens peak consumption when the AC grid is stressed to the breaking point.Environmentally-conscious Germany, Japan and other countries have been using solar panels for many years to reduce energy cost. In parts of Africa where the AC grid is not sufficiently developed to support all household activities, solar panels with battery backup are mandatory. Installing a solar system in energy-rich North America builds an image of being energy savvy rather than doing it for purely economic and environmental reasons. This is evident when spotting a fleet of gas-guzzling cars in the driveway, each with an engine producing 150kW of power to drive to the store and to work.Renewable energy makes economic sense, but it is expensive. The Western World is served with cheap and reliable electricity from the AC grid with a per kilowatt-hour cost as low as US $0.06 in parts of Canada, to $0.15 in many cities and up to $0.40 in some European countries. Meanwhile, electricity produced by a solar panel comes at about $0.20 per kWh. When including peripheral expenses, solar power is more expensive than buying electricity from the utilities in most parts of the world.In spite of the apparent higher cost of renewable energy, putting solar panels on houses is becoming fashionable. The cost of the hardware has fallen, so is the installation. The most common photovoltaic (PV) solar cells are the crystalline silicon type with an efficiency of about 20 percent. In comparison, flexible panels have an efficiency of only about 10 percent. The hardware cost to generate one watt of electricity with solid panels is $2.00–2.50 with trend to go lower.In solar-rich states and countries such as California, Arizona, Hawaii, Japan, as well as in Germany where electricity is expensive and solar subsidized, energy from solar panels is being fed back to the AC grid. This can cause the electrical meter to spin backwards, offsetting previously consumed energy, but it can also induce a problem. The amount of power generated cannot exceed consumption. Dumping more energy into the grid than consumed makes the system unstable, resulting in voltage fluctuations which can overload the circuit and lead to brownouts.Renewable energy has friends and foes. On one side, governments hand out subsidies to install renewable energy systems while utilities on the other side desperately try to stem the move of home electricity generation by reducing incentives, adding fees or pushing home solar companies out of business. Solar companies fight back through regulators, lawmakers and the courts. The utilities argue that spurious energy production by homeowners complicates control and cuts into the revenue stream. They see it as creating glut or famine by means of excess supply during times of plenty and a failing grade when renewable contributions nose-dive while demand is high.The conflict is understandable because utility companies are responsible for providing a stable energy supply when renewable resources are absent. Nor are independent energy producers able provide a dependable solution to an aging grid that moans during peak demand. Right or wrong, producing clean energy from a renewable resource should never be curtailed, especially if the resource can be stored.Storing electrical energy is not new but no system has emerged that is fully satisfactory. One of the most effective storage media for large hydroelectric power stations is to pump water back up to the reservoir during low electrical demand and make it available during peak times. With an efficiency factor of 70–85 percent, pumped hydro is easier to manage than adjusting the generators to satisfy fluctuating power need. Flywheels also serve as energy storage. Large electric motors spin one-ton flywheels when excess energy is available to fill brief energy deficiencies stabilizing the grid. Pumping compressed air into large underground cavities is another way to store energy but for small to medium installations, batteries work best.Storage batteries have mostly been lead acid and users complain about their short life span. This is in part caused by excessive cycling as the battery charges during the day and discharges at night. Lead acid is ill-suited for deep-cycling and this causes excessive wear and a short service life.Another problem is sulfation that builds up when lead acid is not fully charged periodically. A fully saturated charge takes up to 16 hours and no solar system can deliver energy for this long. In addition, electrical consumption tends to increases with time while the solar panels reduce their output due to dirt buildup and aging. This often leaves lead acid with insufficient charge.The Tesla battery solves this in part by using lithium-ion batteries that are more resistant to cycling than lead acid. In addition, Li-ion does not need to be fully charged; in fact a partial charge is better as it relieves stress. However, Li-ion is more expensive than lead acid and Elon Musk cracks this with a mass-market solution by offering a modular household product that suits a broad user base.The Tesla battery stores 7 or 10kWh of energy, enough to keep a home lit and entertainment served for several hours a day. The battery’s power limit of 2kW is sufficient to simultaneously run a fridge, brown toast and perhaps iron the shirts and but it is not ample enough to cook a meal on an electric stove, run the dryer or keep the air conditioner going. Any of these high-energy appliances consumes many times the 2kW limit that the Tesla battery provides. During peak household activity, the AC grid will kick in seamlessly to fill the gap. The Tesla system with solar panels capable of filling the battery during the day is said to reduce the electrical bill by one third to one half.Most solar systems have no battery backup. With lower subsidies and less payout for energy delivered back to the grid, owners of solar systems seek ways to keep the extra resource generated and store it in batteries. This will increased the cost as a solar system with a Li-ion battery will be substantially higher.To fully charge the Tesla battery during the five hours of optimal sunshine per day will require a solar system that delivers 5,000–12,000W. At an estimated cost of $2 per watt, a 10,000W solar hardware alone will come out at $20,000. Installation and the DC-AC converter to convert the solar DC to compatible AC power and synchronize it with the grid might double the cost. The battery will be extra.Another hidden expense when calculating the cost of solar system that is often overlooked is the end-of-life. Solar panels have a life span of 25 years and Tesla guarantees the battery for 10 years. Only time will tell how enduring the Li-ion battery will be in a solar application and how much capacity they will retain after 10 years of continuous service. By all expectations, the Tesla battery will use the same technology that works so well with the Tesla EVs. These electric powertrain batteries use the NCA cells (nickel-cobalt-aluminum) that carry high specific energy and are well suited for deep cycling.Besides limiting the discharge power on the Powerwall to 2kW, another means of adding longevity is a partial charge. Electric vehicles make use of this reduced output range by charging a new battery to only about 80 percent and discharging to roughly 30 percent. As the battery ages and the capacity drops, the battery management system gradually widens the bandwidth and the net effect is an energy delivery system that stays stable not only when the battery is new but even after 10 years of service. Once the full bandwidth must be used to get the full energy with each cycle, the pampering stops and the capacity will begin to fade more quickly because of the added stress.In terms of performance characteristics, the Powerwall will behave more like a hybrid car than an EV. While the EV depends fully on the battery for propulsion, the hybrid still drives with an empty battery but only loses electric assist. In this respect, the hybrid battery is more forgiving. Tests revealed that a hybrid battery with 40 percent capacity had only marginally increased fuel consumption compared to a battery with a 100 percent. In a similar way, the Powerwall will not leave the dweller in the dark and still deliver energy with a partial capacity, albeit the system will become less efficient.Although the purchasing price of Li-ion is higher than lead acid, the cost per cycle is lower due to enhanced longevity and immunity to partial charge. Li-ion is also one of the most efficient batteries in terms of losses during charge and discharge. A battery that became popular with mobile phones, laptops, power tools and medical devices is making inroads into stationary applications but the trusted Lead acid will keep its market share for installations in which deep discharges are only required occasionally, such as UPS. Modern micro-grids supporting renewable resources will mostly be run on Li-ion.\nThe purpose of the Tesla battery is to make mother earth a bit greener but other forms of energy conservations must also be addressed. In terms of energy usage, private cars are one of the least efficient modes of transportation. The internal combustion engine utilizes less than 25 percent of the net calorific value from the fuel for propulsion. Such inefficiency becomes outright disturbing when taking into account the weight of the vehicle with a single passenger, the driver. By accelerating a 1.5-ton vehicle, less than two percent of the energy moves the 75kg (165lb) driver, his briefcase and lunch bag; 98 percent goes to heat, friction and kinetic energy that is mostly lost.The Tesla battery moves us in the right direction without sacrificing comfort and demanding a change in lifestyle. Adding the Powerwall to Tesla’s portfolio of products provides an opportunity for adding a new economy of scale to the battery industry which will drive technological improvements and promote cost reduction. Storing energy for later use will further benefit the battery industry, of which Tesla is increasingly assuming dominance.\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "title": "Managing Batteries for Warehouse Logistics",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/managing-batteries-for-warehouse-logistics",
        "content": "Batteries have become our trusted travel companions; they serve important functions but are a poorly understood as a power source. Batteries work well when new and confidence falls after the first packs fade and need replacing. In time, the battery fleet becomes a jumble of good and bad batteries, and that’s when the headache begins.\nBatteries exhibit human-like qualities. They need good nutrition, prefer cool temperature, but suffer from abuse. Care begins by operating them at cool temperatures, using moderate charge rates and going easy on discharge. It is better not to run batteries down too low but to charging them more often. Avoid ultra-fast charging and harsh loading conditions. There is some truth to why well-cared batteries outperform neglected ones; studies can back this up.\nBattery charging is generally well understood, but the “ready” light is misconstrued. Ready does not mean “able.” There is no link to battery performance, nor does the green light promise a full runtime. Batteries always charge completely, even the weak ones, and ready simply means that the battery is full. With age, the ability to hold charge shrinks and the charge time shortens. This causes faded batteries to gravitate to the top, disguised as combat ready. System collapse is imminent when workers scramble for freshly charged batteries in an emergency. Those glowing ready may be deadwood. (The charge time of a partially charged battery is also short.)\nFigure 1: The “ready” light lies\nThe READY light indicates that the battery is fully charged. This does not mean “able.” There is no link between “ready” and battery performance.\nThe amount of energy a battery can hold is measured in capacity. Capacity is the leading health indicator that determines runtime and predicts end-of-battery-life. A new battery is rated at 100%, but few packs in service deliver the full amount: a workable capacity bandwidth is 80–100%. As a simple guideline, a battery on a portable device having a capacity of 100% typically provides a runtime of ten hours, 80% is eight hours and 70% seven.\nThe service life of a battery is specified in number of cycles. Lithium- and nickel-based batteries deliver between 300 and 500 full discharge/charge cycles before the capacity drops below 80%. Cycling is not the only cause of capacity loss; keeping a battery at elevated temperature also induces stress. A fully charged Li-ion kept at 40°C (104°F) loses about 35% of its capacity in a year without even being used. Ultra-fast chargers and punitive discharging is also harmful, causing a cut in battery life to half, and hobbyists can attest to this.\nBatteries are commonly serviced on a battery analyzer. These instruments became popular in the 1980s to restore nickel-cadmium batteries affected by “memory.” With memory absent in Li-ion, the purpose of a modern battery analyzer is to keep fleet batteries at an acceptable performance level and to retire them when low. Device manufacturers endorse battery analyzers, knowing that well-performing packs reflect positively on their devices, a win-win situation for both parties.\nConventional battery analyzers measure capacity by discharging a fully charged battery and tracking the elapsed time. This procedure is time-consuming and stresses the battery. Rapid-testing is preferred but this only provides estimated state-of-health values and the degree of accuracies varies with the method used. Public safety, medical and defense organizations still rely on periodic full discharge/charge cycles.\nMost battery analyzers feature multi-bays to service a diverse group of batteries. Custom battery adapters configure the analyzer to the correct setting and smart cables enable programming on the fly. With PC software, the computer becomes the host from which all functions are entered. Clicking the mouse on a battery listed in the database configures the analyzer to the correct setting. The user can add, remove and edit the batteries. Figure 2 illustrates Cadex battery analyzers running on PC-BatteryShop displaying battery test results in real time.\nFigure 2: Battery analyzers with PC software\nWith PC software, the computer becomes the command center.\nPC-operated battery maintenance systems offer several services, one of which is marking all batteries with a permanent ID number. A printer generates these labels in bar code format. To service a battery, the user simply scans the label and inserts the battery into the analyzer. Past battery performance data are made available that may also include purchasing dates, vendor information and pricing. Figure 3 illustrates such a system.\nFigure 3: Fleet battery management\nLabeling each battery with a unique ID numbersimplifies battery service. Swiping the barcodelabel prepares the analyzer for service. Pastlogs are displayed on the monitor.\nAnother service method is attaching a label that displays the last service, due date, capacity and internal resistance. Figure 4 illustrates such a label. The system is self-governing in that a prudent user will only pick a battery that has been serviced and meets the capacity requirements. Expired packs are analyzed and if the capacity requirements are met, relabeled and returned to service.\nFigure 4: Sample of removable battery label\nBasic battery data and service informationare contained on a label.\nMost fleet operations use 80% as a battery pass/fail criterion. A day’s work is not complete without also examining the reserve capacity before recharge, and a battery analyzer can perform such spot checks. If the lowest-performing battery in the fleet still has 20–30% reserve, then the target capacity can be lowered to 70%. Such fine-tuning finds the sweet spot between risk management and economics.\nBattery analyzers also perform incoming inspections. A new vendor may offer a lower-priced pack but the performance, consistency and longevity are unknown. The analyzer automatically cycles the battery and stops at selected target capacity, storing the cycle count, voltage and temperature characteristics.\nRechargeable batteries do not die suddenly but the capacity diminishes gradually. Batteries in daily use should be serviced once every 1–3 months. The time required is minimal; analyzing a battery fleet with an automated battery analyzer requires only about 30 minutes per day. A four-station battery analyzer offers a throughput of about 160 batteries when done on a monthly maintenance schedule.\nIn-house battery maintenance is not practical for everyone and large organizations hire outside firms to provide this service. The incoming battery specialist will first validate all batteries by a full analysis and replace packs that do not meet the capacity threshold. Good batteries are identified with a service label and returned. Test intervals and capacity threshold will need to be agreed prior. A two-tier system may be installed in which lower-capacity batteries are reassigned to less critical applications. Such a maintenance procedure leads to higher reliability and lower operating costs.\nMany IT Managers are faced with the daunting task of keeping battery replacement costs down and system reliability high. Some device manufacturers recommend replacing the battery annually, but such advice only suits the battery supplier as the cost and environmental impact would be prohibitively high. Batteries have improved, so has the service life. In addition, some applications are energy savvy and batteries with capacities as low as 70% can power the scanner for an entire shift. There is no need to replace these batteries too soon, but the state-of-health of the fleet batteries must be known.\nAn IT manager of a warehouse logistics facility in the USA says this about their newly installed battery management system (paraphrased).\n“Experiencing continuous high battery replacement costs, we purchased a battery maintenance system. After only four months of use, we saved over $6,800 using the CADEX C7400. Next year we hope to save over $10,000. The ability to analyze our battery inventory has not only reduced our yearly cost on new batteries but also lowered downtime for employees. Batteries last for the full shift; defective batteries are identified and removed immediately.”\nBattery maintenance eliminates battery-related breakdowns and saves money. The payback of a modern battery analyzer is typically less than one year; improved reliability and environmental benefit are side benefits. Operation is simple and the required service time per day is short.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/the-future-battery",
        "content": "How much has the battery improved during the last 150 years? Compared to other advancements, the progress has only been moderate. A battery holds relatively little power, is bulky, heavy, and has a short life span. Battery power is also very expensive. The smaller the battery, the higher the cost-per-watt becomes. Yet humanity depends on the battery as an important portable power source.The speed at which portability and mobility is advancing hinges much on the battery. So important is this energy source that engineers design handheld devices around the battery, rather than the other way around. With each incremental improvement of the battery, the doors swing open for new products and enhanced applications. It is the virtue of the battery that provides us with the freedom of being disconnected from home and office. The better the battery gets, the greater our mobility and freedom will become.The improved runtime of new portable devices is not credited to higher energy-dense batteries alone. Much improvement has been made in reducing the power consumption of portable devices. Some of these advancements are, however, counteracted with the demand for faster processing time of laptop computers and quicker data transmission of cellular phones. The electric vehicle has failed to become the accepted mode of transportation because of the battery. Short distances between recharging and a limited service life of the battery are to blame. Consumers demand a battery that will last for the life of the vehicle but battery manufactures are hesitant to provide the mandatory 8 to 10-year warranty. Battery research is proceeding at a steady pace. The average annual gain in capacity is typically 6%. In comparison, microelectronics has done much betterGordon Moore made his famous observation in 1965 when he predicted that the growth in the number of transistors per integrated circuit would double every two years. Through Intel's relentless technological advances, Moore's Law has been maintained and is being carried into the 21st century. Such advances would shrink a heavy-duty car battery to size of a coin, had this been possible for batteries.\nMore than 2,000 organizations throughout the world are actively involved in fuel cell development. There is a good reason for this - it's a great concept. And yet, since its invention in 1839 by Sir William Grove, the fuel cell has made little impact in our daily lives so far. In comparison, the internal combustion engine, a development that began at about the same time as the fuel cell, has far broader use.The fuel cell was used in the Gemini space program in the 1960s, followed by trial runs in buses and cars during the 1990s. One of the main obstacles is high energy cost. The cost-per-watt. must be reduced by a factor of ten to become competitive with other sources, such as the internal combustion engine. The improvements of the fuel cell during the last 10 years have been moderate. Attempts to mass-produce have failed, even though four public fuel cell companies in North America have raised over a billion dollars in public stock offerings from 1999 through 2001. Unlike other investments that paid early dividends from product sale, returns on fuel cell lies years ahead. Today, 45% of the money raised by the four fuel cell companies is lost. Fuel cell advocates are promoting a technology that is intended to replace the battery but the opposite is occurring in mobile and portable applications. The fuel cell has a defined power band in which it operates efficiently. Outside this band, the fuel cell loses effectiveness. Sluggish start-up when cold and limited loading are other limitations. Until resolved, the fuel cell will serve as the generator to charge the batteries that do the driving. There are also problems with the longevity of the stack. The membranes, the core of the engine, degenerate too quickly. The replacement of the stack is a major expense. Until these problems can be resolved, the fuel cell will be reserved for specialty applications, such as providing power (and water) for space vehicles and submarines. Here, no combustion is possible and toxic exhausts cannot be tolerated.Experts believe that the fuel cell, as we know it today, would only be implemented in vehicles if the supply of fossil fuel is exhausted or if mandated by law due to environmental concerns. Comments have been made that the fuel cell may never become the engine of choice for mass-produced cars. This is in line with the notion that the steam engine of the 1800s was never intended to propel airplanes. Continuous improvements in the fuel cell are being made but the results are slower than with other technologies. Eventually, the fuel cell will find important niche markets that dwell outside the domain of the polluting internal combustion engine. Should a major break-through occur and the fuel cell does become an alternative power source, the world would become a cleaner place and humanity would be thankful for it.\nThe ultimate miracle battery is nowhere in sight and the battery remains the 'weak link' for the foreseeable future. As long as the battery is based on an electro-chemical process, limitations of power density and short life expectancy must be taken into account. We must adapt to this constraint and design the equipment around it.People want an inexhaustible pool of energy in a small package that is cheap, safe and clean. A radical turn will be needed to satisfy the unquenchable thirst for portable and mobile power. It is anyone's guess whether a superior electro-chemical battery, an improved fuel cell, a futuristic atomic fusion battery or some other groundbreaking energy storage device will fulfill this dream. For many, this break will not come in ones lifetime.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Advanced batteries diagnostics resemble face recognition in which a camera takes a multi-dimensional image to identify a person’s feature with artificial intelligence (AI).\nSimilarly, a complex measuring device analyzes the electrochemical evidence of a battery to assess SoH with AI, of which capacity is the leading health indicator.\nModern battery analytics observe subtle changes in battery performance by tracking capacity fade to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Cloud analytic systems are in development that will usher in “social networking in battery care,” one of which is RUBY. RUBY stands for Remaining Useful Battery Yield.\nBatteries are commonly installed and forgotten. With RUBY, the fleet supervisor keeps inventory by tracking the RUL of each battery. Figure 2 demonstrates a system that observes the battery with a complex measuring device and displays the test results on a monitor, assisted by cloud analytics. The RUBY system will serve portable batteries and stationary installations.\nWhen new, a battery delivers a capacity of 100%. On a 10Ah pack, this relates to a 10A discharge lasting one hour. Usage and age reduce the battery capacity and a typical end-of-life setting of 80%.\nMost battery applications allow a 20% capacity loss before a replacement is needed. Device manufacturers also include a safety margin in Reserve Charge that is set to 20% in Figure 3. These provisions reduce the Energy Allocation of a battery from 100% to 60% in worst case scenarios.\nModern diagnostic chargers (Cadex) feature a Target Selector that passes good batteries and red-flags packs dropping below the 80%. SMBus batteries provide the SoH by the Full Charge Capacity (FCC); regular batteries use the Parser\nbased on the Extended Kalman Filter and coulomb counting.\nThe end-of-life threshold is based on the “what-if.” Figure 4 illustrates pass/fail threshold settings for different applications, governed by risk management. The diagnostic charger checks the usable capacity of a battery against the target setting and passes packs with a green SoH Light when meeting the threshold; below target produces a red light. The SoH Light gives users a simple indication when to service or replace a battery, tailored for each industry.\n“What pass/fail capacity do I select?” is a common question asked by users of portable batteries. With the intelligent Target Selector facilitated by RUBY, the diagnostic charger observes the Reserve Charge before charge. Think of an airline pilot who assures having enough fuel to enable a safe landing.\nIf, for example, the energy demands of a battery increase in a two-way radio, such as hosting the Olympics, the intelligent Target Selector raises the setting to retain the same Reserve Charge with higher traffic. This will prompt more batteries with marginal performance to fail. If, however, energy demands decreases, the Target Selector relaxes the setting and batteries can be kept in service longer.\nRUBY displays the usable capacity of each fleet battery. Reserve Charge is in black and gray. With learned data, RUL can also be given in years. Failing packs are marked in red. Figure 5 illustrates the screen.\nAs society needs doctors; so will a battery-powered economy rely on battery diagnostics. RCM (Reliability-centered Maintenance) was a forerunner of RUBY in the 1960s to maintain the new 747 jumbo jet. The US military adopted RCM, followed by nuclear power plants, commuter rail and other industries. RUBY will improve stresses and longevity related knowledge in batteries\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Believers of electric vehicles (EV) may overlook the environmental impact of manufacturing and driving a seemingly clean vehicle. What many policy makers and business leaders ignore is how polluting these cars are. The challenge goes beyond what comes out of the tailpipe and includes building the vehicles.\nFigure 1 reveals higher CO2 contributions building an EV compared to a car with internal combustion engine (ICE). Long-range EVs with large batteries distort the numbers further.\nFigure 1:\n Greenhouse gas emission (kg on CO2)\nThe greenhouse gas intensity of the EV is mainly caused by the battery.\nSource: Greenpeace East Asia, Cradle-to-gate greenhouse gas emissions breakdown by material\nThis 2021 study by Bloomberg supports a 2019 report published by ADAC*, Germany, and Joanneum Research, Austria, saying that manufacturing an EV generates more carbon dioxide (CO2) than a vehicle with a conventional ICE engine. According to a research fellow at the Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, generating 1kWh of electricity by coal produces 1kg of CO2, similar to driving 6km (3.75 miles) in a luxury car. Manufacturing a 1kWh Li-ion produces 75kg of CO2, the same as burning 35 liters (7.7 gallons) of gasoline.\n* ADAC is an acronym for Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club; General German Automobile Club. ADAC is Europe's largest motoring association.\nTable 2 compares the CO2 emitted manufacturing and driving vehicles with a diesel engine versus an electric powertrain.\nTable 2:\n CO2 emission of electric vs. diesel cars as a function of driven km.\n Breakeven is at 225,000km.\nSource: ADAC study (2019) with Joanneum Research, Graz, Austria.\n The study was based on a VW Golf-size car.\n The study also included a gasoline-powered car that emits 43 tons of CO2 at 225,000km\nBased on higher CO2 emissions building an EV versus a vehicle with ICE, the EV needs to drive 225,000km to break even with a diesel-powered vehicle. (Volkswagen marks this odometer reading as the end-of-life of a car.) Labeling EV zero-emission is incorrect because, in many regions, electricity is generated by fossil fuel. Producing 1kWh of electricity by coal produces 0.94kg (2 lbs) of CO2.\nUnless electricity can be produced from renewable resources, the EV does not provide the expected solution to CO2 reduction. A compromise is a mild hybrid with a small ICE and a 48V battery that reduces fuel consumption by up to 40%. A plug-in hybrid would provide most daily commuting by battery power. The focus should be on vehicle size and weight. A full-size EV battery weighs 500kg (1,100 lb) and represents 40% of the vehicle cost.\nThe planned CO2 reductions by 2050 may not be feasible or affordable with today’s technologies. Changing road transport from fossil fuel to electric is expected to double electric energy demand; however, EVs can be charged at night during low usage. Most houses are also heated with natural gas that generates CO2. Changing to electrical heat will further stress the electrical grid. Because of its high calorific value, air travel will continue to rely on fossil fuel.\nA separate study in 2007, also done in Germany, claims that electric vehicles emit more CO2 than their diesel-powered counterparts. This reignites the debate of driving a Toyota Prius versus a Hummer. The CNW Market Research study includes energy costs from “dust-to-dust.” If the report is correct, the total environmental cost to society for a Prius is $2 per km ($3.30 per mile), while the Hummer comes in at $1.2 ($1.95). CNW includes energy costs to produce the vehicles from manufacturing to recycling and disposal of materials.\nMany argue that environmental damage and energy consumption are synonymous. Electricity generation matters and should come from renewable sources. Being relatively new to the industry, hybrids and electric vehicles also incur high R&D costs. Then we must look at mining and processing of lithium, cobalt, and manganese used for the Li-ion battery. None of these are “clean energy” and the re-usage of recycled materials is often more energy-intense and costly than mining anew(See BU-311: Battery Raw Materials)\nA report estimates that a finished EV battery represents 40% of the value of an electric vehicle. The Li-ion cells are energy-intensive to manufacture and use rare and expensive raw materials. Increasingly, these materials must be minded in an environmentally friendly way. Some materials, such as cobalt, may become short supply, affecting pricing.\nAdvances are being made to recycle Li-ion batteries(See BU-705: How to Recycle Batteries) to enable re-usage. Not all materials derived from recycled Li-ion by reach battery-grade level quality and may be used for other purposes. Lithium is also used as a lubricant.\nConcerned consumers should buy a high-fuel-economy vehicle or bicycle to work. Physical activity also contributes to our personal well-being.\nWhen people hear the word graphite, they think pencil. Highly purified graphite will increasingly serve as materials to manufacture batteries. Natural graphite is at the heart of the energy revolution. It is an important component of lithium-ion batteries but current graphite purification involves processes that are hard on the environment(See also BU-309: How does Graphite Work in Li-ion?)\nUsed as anode material in Li-ion, natural graphite concentrate must be purified to contain less than 500 ppm of impurities. Current purification processes are mainly done in China and require a large quantity of chemicals that have a negative environmental impact. In the near future, purification can be done with new green technology, such as hydroelectricity.\nProducing battery-grade lithium is also energy and resource intense. Lithium is commonly mined in tropical areas where efforts are made to use renewable resources for extraction and processing.\nLife cycle emissions refer to production, use and disposal of a product expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) Table 5 compares CO2\ngeneration of the internal combustion engine ICE), hybrid and electric vehicle (EV).\nTable 5: CO2 life cycle emission of electric versus internal computation engine (ICE)\nNote: Total amount of greenhouse gases emitted of medium sized vehicle over 16 years and 240,000km. Source: Polestar and Rivian Pathway Report (2023)\nThe EV lowers tailpipe emissions, but switching from ICE to EV only reduces the overall emission from 100% to 71% in a full life-cycle of 240,000km (150,000 miles). Raw materials extraction and refining of lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite are energy-intensive and polluting. We also keep in mind that roughly 60% of electricity is generated by fossil fuel. Solar and wind power alone are not sufficient to secure future electrical demand.\nThe switch to EVs could double the demand for electrical power; however, some charging can be done at night when load is light. CO2 reduction of an EV could also be achieved by mandating smaller and lighter vehicles.\nLong-term investment should go beyond the private car and also improve public transportation. Efficient train service will provide a higher return in future generations than everyone driving a car that weighs 10 times more than the occupant. The ratio reverses with micromobility (See also BU-1006: Cost of Mobile and Renewable Power.)\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "The electrolyte of a stratified battery concentrates at the bottom, starving the upper half of the cell. Acid stratification occurs if the battery dwells at low charge (below 80 percent), never receives a full charge and has shallow discharges. Driving a car for short distances with power-robbing accessories engaged contributes to acid stratification because the alternator cannot always apply a saturated charge. Large luxury cars are especially prone to acid stratification. This is not a battery defect per se but is application related. Figure 1 illustrates a normal battery in which the acid is equally distributed from top to bottom.\nThe acid is equally distributed from the top to the bottom of the battery, providing good overall performance.\nFigure 2 shows a stratified battery in which the acid concentration is light on top and heavy on the bottom. The light acid on top limits plate activation, promotes corrosion and reduces the performance, while the high acid concentration on the bottom makes the battery appear more charged than it is and artificially raises the open circuit voltage. The unequal charge across the plates reduces CCA (cold cranking amps), and starting the engine is sluggish.\nThe acid concentration is light on top and heavy on the bottom. This raises the open circuit voltage and the battery appears fully charged. Excessive acid concentration induces sulfation on the lower half of the plates.\nAllowing the battery to rest for a few days, doing a shaking motion or tipping the battery on its side helps correct the problem. Applying an equalizing charge by raising the voltage of a 12-volt battery to 16 volts for 1–2 hours also helps by mixing the electrolyte through electrolysis. Avoid extending the topping charge beyond its recommended time. Topping charge is applied to maintain full charge and to prevent sulfation on lead acid batteries.\nAcid stratification cannot always be avoided. During cold winter months, starter batteries of most passenger cars dwell at a 75 percent charge level. Knowing that motor idling and driving in gridlocked traffic does not sufficiently charge the battery; charge the battery occasionally with an external charger. If this is not practical, switch to an AGM battery. AGM does not suffer from acid stratification and is less sensitive to sulfation if undercharged than the flooded version. AGM is a bit more expensive than the flooded version but the battery should last longer.\nLead acid batteries are sluggish and cannot convert lead sulfate to lead and lead dioxide quickly during charge. This delayed action causes most of the charge activities to occur on the plate surfaces, resulting in an elevated state-of-charge (SoC) on the outside.\nA battery with surface charge has a slightly elevated voltage and gives a false voltage-based SoC reading. To normalize the condition, switch on electrical loads to remove about 1 percent of the battery’s capacity or allow the battery to rest for a few hours. Turning on the headlights for a few minutes will do this. Surface charge is not a battery defect but a reversible condition.\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Propulsion by an electric powertrain is not new — Ferdinand Porsche designed a hybrid vehicle in 1898. Called the Lohner-Porsche carriage, the hybrid function served as an electrical transmission; its purpose was not to lower fuel consumption as the focus is today. With Mr. Porsche in the driver’s seat, the car broke several speed records in Austria in 1901.\nAnother early hybrid was the Woods Motor Vehicle built in Chicago in 1915. It had a four-cylinder internal combustion engine (ICE) in conjunction with an electric motor. Below 25km/h (15mph), the electric motor propelled the vehicle; at higher speeds the gasoline engine kicked in to take the vehicle up to 55km/h (35mph).\nIn early 1900, a car buyer had three choices of propulsion systems: electric, steam, and ICE, of which the ICE was the least common. The electric cars (EVs) appealed to the upper class and they were finished with fancy interiors and expensive materials. Although higher in price than the steam and gasoline-powered vehicles, the EV served the wealthy with its quiet and comfortable ride over the vibrating, smelly and maintenance-prone gasoline-powered counterpart. Best of all, the EV did not require changing gears. Back then, the knuckle-busting chore of shifting gears was the most dreaded task when driving a gasoline-powered car. Nor did the EV need manual cranking to start the engine, a task the upper class did not want to be seen doing. Since the only good roads were in town, the limited range of the EV posed no problem; most driving was local commuting.\nThe Detroit Electric, one of the most popular EVs then, was said to get 130km (80 miles) between battery charges. Its top speed was 32km/h (20mph), a pace considered adequate for driving. Physicians and women were the main buyers. Thomas Edison, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and Clara Ford, the wife of Henry Ford, drove Detroit Electrics. Figure 1 shows Thomas Edison with his 1914 Detroit Electric model.\nThe battery of choice for the EV was lead acid. At a higher price point, the buyer could fit the Detroit Electric with a nickel-iron (NiFe), a battery Thomas Edison promoted for its superior cycle life and good performance at subfreezing and hot temperatures. The NiFe had a cell voltage of 1.2V, was robust and could endure overcharging and repeated full discharging but on a purely performance level, NiFe provided only a slightly better specific energy to lead acid and was expensive to manufacture. In addition, the battery had a high self-discharge of 20–40 percent per month, greater than the 5 percent with lead acid.\nIn 1914 a devastating fire destroyed the Edison factory, and the popularity of nickel-iron waned. Production of the EV peaked in 1912 and continued until the 1920s. Batteries already posed limitations in the electric powertrain a hundred years ago. Thomas Edison knew this and commented, “Just as soon as a man gets working on the secondary battery, it brings out his latent capacity for lying.”\nHenry Ford’s mass-production and cost-cutting measures in 1912 of the Model T were not the only reason for the shift to gasoline-powered cars. The invention of the starter motor in 1912, the need to travel long distances and the discovery of Texas crude oil made the ICE more attractive and affordable to the general public.\nThe EV became a thing of the past until the early 1990s when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) mandated more fuel-efficient and lower-emission vehicles. It was the CARB zero-emission policy that prompted General Motors to produce the EV1. Available for lease between 1996 and 1999, the EV1 initially ran on an 18kWh lead acid battery that was later replaced with a 26kWh NiMH.\nAlthough the NiMH had an impressive driving range of 260km (160 miles), the EV1 was not without problems. Manufacturing costs rose to three times that of a regular gasoline-powered car. In 2001, politicians changed the CARB requirements, which prompted General Motors to withdraw the EV1, to the dismay of many owners. In the 2006 documentary film Who Killed the Electric Car?, governments give a mixed message regarding cleaner transportation.\nLow cost and high current capabilities make lead acid a good candidate for starter applications. It has about 720Wh, is forgiving if abused and cranks the engine even if the capacity has dropped to 30 percent. Batteries for the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) are about twice this size, and the plug-in has about 12.5kWh; EVs go from 15kWh to 90Wh. Figure 2 compares the battery sizes.\nWhile starter and hybrid batteries are tolerant to capacity fade, a weak EV battery travels shorter distances.\nBatteries and cost per kWh vary greatly according to chemistry. Table 3 estimates the price of the most common batteries in use today. At $120 per kWh, a deep-cycle-battery for golf cars and wheelchairs is most economical, followed by the starter, forklift and stationary batteries. Complex manufacturing, electronic safety circuits and battery management systems (BMS) make newer technologies more expensive than older systems, even with volume production.\n[1] Source: National Museum of American History\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-1007-net-calorific-value",
        "content": "Since the beginning of time, wood was a readily available fuel to mankind; however during the medieval period, King Henry VIII (1491–1547) was concerned that England could not produce enough wood for heating, cooking and building houses and he urged citizens to conserve. Coal mining in the 1700s lifted this apparent shortage and the abundant new energy source became the nucleus for the Industrial Revolution. But burning large amounts of coal soon began to darken the skies over cities and caused health problems.\nIn 1859, explorers discovered oil, first in Pennsylvania and then in Texas. By 1900, the Middle East became a key supplier of oil, and after World War I, Mexico, Venezuela and Iran began pumping liquid energy. Oil was cheap, plentiful, easy to transport, safe to use and relatively clean to burn; it soon became the preferred energy resource.\nAs wood led to coal and coal to oil, scientists turned to nuclear power to generate what was seen as an unlimited pool of energy at low cost. The common nuclear fuels are uranium-235 and plutonium-239, of which plutonium-239 is so powerful that 1kg can produce nearly 10 million kWh of electricity. Science writer David Dietz (1897–1984) wrote, “Instead of filling the gas tank of your car two or three times a week, you will travel for a year on a pellet of atomic energy the size of a vitamin pill.”\nIn the 1950s, nuclear plants began generating electricity and nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers became common. Amendments were written and the Atomic Energy Act invited the private sector to harness nuclear energy. This was met with a sharp learning curve that led to accidents and meltdowns. The most serious nuclear accidents were Three Mile Island in the USA, Chernobyl in the Ukraine and Fukushima in Japan. The enormity of damage led to slowing nuclear growth and to this day, radiation and disposal of spent fuel remains a problem.\nScientists pointed to hydrogen as the next energy miracle as it has an unlimited supply and is clean. Cars powered by the hydrogen fuel cells would run so clean that the hot water from the tailpipe could be used to serve tea. But hydrogen is expensive to produce because it takes as much energy to create as it delivers. After much anticipation, hydrogen became a pipedream.\nMuch of the global energy comes by burning hydrocarbons in the form of petroleum, natural gas and coal that are leftovers of living matter from past geological times. The sun, the source of all life, provided these canned energies but they are non-renewable. Figure 1 illustrates the fuels used to generate electricity. Coal, the most common fuel, produces the highest amount of CO2; natural gas is about half that of the coal equivalent, and oil sits somewhere in between.\nCoal is cheap but emits about twice the CO2 of natural gas. The CO2 emmission of oil is in between coal and natural gas.\nTable 1 lists the net calorific value (NCV) and efficiency of various energy sources in Wh per liter. Diesel and gasoline overshadow hydrogen and the Li-ion battery in terms of NCV. Any departure from a simple combustion process to harvest energy is met with higher energy costs, but the gain must be offset with the benefit of generating less greenhouse gas (CO2).\nDiesel and gasoline surpass hydrogen and Li-ion. The conversion efficiency is thermal output and does not include friction and drag.\n* CNG (compressed natural gas) is 250 bars (3,625psi)** Hydrogen is at 350 bar (5,000psi)\nTable 2 provides a summary of the net calorific values of ancient and modern fuels by mass (kg) and volume (liter). With the exception of hydrogen by mass, hydrocarbons offer the highest energy by weight.\n* Hydrogen has the highest energy to mass ratio (Wh/kg), but energy by volume (Wh/l) reveals a truer picture in terms of storage and delivery. Diesel has almost 14 times the specific energy of pure hydrogen by volume (750Wh/l at 350 bar or 5,000psi)\nOil and natural gas can be drawn from the earth cheaply and with little preparation. Hydrogen, in comparison, needs energy to be produced and it is hard to store. Economics are a deciding factor when choosing a fuel for heating and mobility. This puts environmental issues on the backburner. Fossil fuel is among the cheapest, most efficient and readily available fuels, but the ecological harm when consumed in large scale is beginning to get everyone’s attention.\n[1] Courtesy: Internal Energy Agency\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "A battery leaves the manufacturing plant with characteristics that delivers optimal performance. Do not modify the physics of a good battery unless needed to revive a dying pack. Adding so-called “enhancement medicine” to a good battery may have negative side effects. Many services to improve the performance of lead acid batteries can be achieved with topping charge(See BU-403: Charging Lead Acid)\nAdding chemicals to the electrolyte of flooded lead acid batteries can dissolve the buildup of lead sulfate on the plates and improve the overall battery performance. This treatment has been in use since the 1950s (and perhaps longer) and provides a temporary performance boost for aging batteries. It’s a stopgap measure because in most cases the plates are already worn out through shedding. Chemical additives cannot replace the active material, nor can cracked plates, corroded connectors or damaged separators be restored with an outside remedy.\nElevated self-discharge is a common failure mode with older batteries. With the shedding of the active material to the bottom of the container, a conductive layer forms that gradually fills the allotted space in the sediment trap. The now conductive liquid may reach the plates, creating a soft short. The shedding also causes the internal resistance to increase, reducing current handling.\nExtending the service life of an aging battery can be useful as additives are cheap, readily available and worth the experiment for a handyman. These salts may reduce the internal resistance to give a sulfated battery a few extra months of life. Suitable additives are magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt), caustic soda and EDTA (EDTA is a crystalline acid used in industry).\nWhen using Epsom salt, follow these easy steps to treat most starter batteries. Heat about 250ml (8 fl oz or a cup) of distilled water to about 66ºC (150ºF), mix in as much Epson salt as the water can absorb (a few tablespoons) and stir until dissolved. Avoid using too much salt because heavy concentration increases corrosion of the lead plates and the internal connectors.\nWhen pouring the warm solution into the battery, the electrolyte level will raise. Do not remove electrolyte, and only add as much additive as the battery can take. Be careful not to overfill. Do not place un-dissolved Epsom salt directly into the battery because the substance does not dissolve well. In place of Epsom salt, try adding a pinch of caustic soda. Charge the battery after service. The results are not instantaneous and it may take a month for the treatment to work. The outcome is not guaranteed.\nBatteries have improved, and additive treatments may be most effective with older battery models, expanding their life by a few months until a replacement is on hand. Modern batteries already include additives that reduce sulfation and corrosion. Industrial users seldom rely on remedial additives to prolong battery life as the system becomes maintenance prone.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

So cuz time constraints w work and life and a gf I tend to make a quick decision on things.  This quick decision was adding Epson salt directly into the flooded LA car battery I had.  I think I may have or had a parasitic load on the battery due to my ignition system staying in a position that kept the starter energized.  Or something.  That part is still unknown. What is known is my successful or so far successful at bringing a flooded LA battery back from holding no charge.  I bought a battery maintainer which I’m not happy with. It was a battery tender and maintainer 1.25 amps 12 volt. Bought it for my SLA batteries I had just bought 100amps 12 volts times four.  Yes I know not the right thing to use but at the time I had little knowledge in lead acid batteries. Actually charging batteries in general. Typically people who don’t get all into it or who don’t care why or just accept battery decline and pre mature death and buy a new one usually just buy a charger if they even take that step, but buy a charger that say smart charger. Or revitalize or bring back to life or some dumb sales gimmick.  The little I knew which is leaps more then the average person in relation to batteries in general, but I knew lead acid like to have a constant high state of charge. Therefore I did not concern myself w amps or stages. Or pulse or boost or desulfate or happy ending w reach around.  It didn’t matter.  But money became tight.  And I refuse to throw anything away I know I can fix which leads us to the epson salt and the piece of crud tender I had.  The tender charged the flooded battery to 14.5 and then a float charge of 13.5. I believe at first it did float 13.1-13.3.  Which it was give me one or two starts for my truck. So obviously something wasn’t right.  Why the explicit was it saying it’s charged and yet I get crap energy from it.  On top of that in the very beginning it would say charged but lose the charge over night.  So long story short. I whipped out my lifepo4 12 volt charger.  Which is also a piece of crap for charging lifepo4 from what I’ve been reading a constant over charge is not good for lithium chemistry.  What the crap did I know.  But I did read about some epson salt and maybe that would work w the lead acid battery tender.  I shook the battery. Mixed it up that way. Prob used the way wrong epson salt cuz later after reading the ingredients it read fragrance added.  Ehh whatever. I didn’t give the cells too much salt. I gave the one cell that I thought was the worse of the 6 the most.  Shook it up. Still  not making magic.  So here enters the constant 14.5-14.6 volt charge of the lifepo4 charger I had.  Let me back up. So when I had starting trouble in my truck I just jumped it w one of my 20volt drill batteries.  Worked alright.  Did it again. Same result.  Did it again and no go. Turned out to be a starter problem. Anyways. I had read to open the caps to release gas or vent it better when charging the flooded lead acid.  So I did that. Did that for awhile.  Might still do that. Might. Not. Won’t side track just yet on that.  So as I was jumping my truck w the 20volt during the no go time I had left the battery from the drill on there longer. To try and get it more charged.  And what I saw were little bubbles coming up from the cells.  Thinking I was totally f’n the battery up I removed the 20volt drill battery and tried starting the truck.  Nothing. Cuz the starter.  Anyways. Fast forward. To the lifepo4 charger.  Epson salt added.  Attached the lithium charger. And sure enough the bubbles came back.  So I’m like. F it. What’s the worst that can happen.  Leave there for some time.  Use it as well.  Starts up the truck fine. But loses charge still. I take the bastard into my room and charge it. Open a window and turn on fans and my diy zeolite/coco activated carbon air filtration system. W m12 or some ish filters.  That’s another story.  Another time.  Anyways. I leave the bastard charging on the constant 14.5-14.6 charge.  I’m also smoking in the room w it. Knowing the full danger of hydrogen being released from the reactions going on inside the battery cuz I started reading about what to do to bring the battery back.  I did see the flame act funny time to time when using it and at those times I left the room and aired it out.  I live dangerously.  Anyways.  I charged this guy on and off for about 7-10 days.  When it get hot I’d rest it. Or I’d put the crap tender on it and let it float.  My dumbass even scraped the plates inside the cells w my dmm leads.  I’m an electrician so electrical stuff doesn’t scare me anymore. But reading later about how easy lead toxicity and exposure is w these batteries does and did scare me. So I didn’t f w the plates anymore.  I did scrape them tho. And my leads got corrosion now on then from the sulphuric acid.  I later read not to add epson Salt. So that want and urge to add more was now gone.  Until I read this article now.  But anyways.  The electrolyte went from cloudy from the Salt I reckon to clear.  And the bad cell I added the most salt too took the longest. But became clear. The bubbles became less.  And the gunk in on the plates became less.  I’m writing this experience mostly because I never write anything but this past day I have done it twice now.  So I figure keep it going.  Maybe help someone. Maybe get a laugh or a shrill. Anyways. I know now that in need to give the battery a charge w current up to 10% of the total amps.  And then at about 70% charge or whatever then reduce the current and keep the constant high voltage charge until 100 percent lowering currrent along the way.  Basically. Current charge the. To voltage charge. Then to either w float charge or to an equalizing over charge to help break up those pesky crystals. Or so I think now.  I have four sla batteries I’m messing w now.  They didn’t hold up as well as I’d like this last power outage.  That’s another story for another time.  Something along the lines of break in period.  Probably sulfates from improper storage practices.  Etc. anyways.  Back to the flooded la.  What I noticed. Is this.  As I desulphated it the float charge would increase every time.  So what I believe happened was.  Due to poor flooded la battery care the battery lost its ability to hold a charge even tho It was reading 13.4 volts when I charged it in the beginning before the epson salt and the high voltage constant charge.  So it confused me.  Don’t let it confuse you. It’s just sulfated.  And I recommend getting a power supply you can adjust the current and volts on.  It’s better then trusting a “smart” charger.  Every battery is made differently. Go off of manufactures guidelines and adjust your power supply accordingly.  From the amount of reading I’ve done people still argue what the best way to charge a lead acid battery. Flooded or sealed.  Or agm.  Go off the manufacturer’s guidelines.  Do a constant charge to what it says.  And then float it to what it says.  May not be fancy but it will keep the battery working a long time.  Just keep heat away from it and keep flooded flooded.

        "content": "Measuring state-of-charge by voltage is simple, but it can be inaccurate because cell materials and temperature affect the voltage. The most blatant error of the voltage-based SoC occurs when disturbing a battery with a charge or discharge. The resulting agitation distorts the voltage and it no longer represents a correct SoC reference. To get accurate readings, the battery needs to rest in the open circuit state for at least four hours; battery manufacturers recommend 24 hours for lead acid. This makes the voltage-based SoC method impractical for a battery in active duty.\nEach battery chemistry delivers its own unique discharge signature. While voltage-based SoC works reasonably well for a lead acid battery that has rested, the flat discharge curve of nickel- and lithium-based batteries renders the voltage method impracticable.\nThe discharge voltage curves of Li-manganese, Li-phosphate and NMC are very flat, and 80 percent of the stored energy remains in the flat voltage profile. While this characteristic is desirable as an energy source, it presents a challenge for voltage-based fuel gauging as it only indicates full charge and low charge; the important middle section cannot be estimated accurately. Figure 1 reveals the flat voltage profile of Li-phosphate (LiFePO) batteries.\nLi-phosphate has a very flat discharge profile, making voltage estimations for SoC estimation difficult.\nLead acid comes with different plate compositions that must be considered when measuring SoC by voltage. Calcium, an additive that makes the battery maintenance-free, raises the voltage by 5–8 percent. In addition, heat raises the voltage while cold causes a decrease. Surface charge further fools SoC estimations by showing an elevated voltage immediately after charge; a brief discharge before measurement counteracts the error. Finally, AGM batteries produce a slightly higher voltage than the flooded equivalent.\nWhen measuring SoC by open circuit voltage (OCV), the battery voltage must be “floating” with no load attached. This is not the case with modern vehicles. Parasitic loads for housekeeping functions puts the battery into a quasi-closed circuit voltage (CCV) condition.\nIn spite of inaccuracies, most SoC measurements rely in part or completely on voltage because of simplicity. Voltage-based SoC is popular in wheelchairs, scooters and golf cars. Some innovative BMS (battery management systems) use the rest periods to adjust the SoC readings as part of a “learn” function. Figure 2 illustrates the voltage band of a 12V lead acid monoblock from fully discharged to full charged.\nThe hydrometer offers an alternative to measuring SoC of flooded lead acid batteries. Here is how it works: When the lead acid battery accepts charge, the sulfuric acid gets heavier, causing the specific gravity (SG) to increase. As the SoC decreases through discharge, the sulfuric acid removes itself from the electrolyte and binds to the plate, forming lead sulfate. The density of the electrolyte becomes lighter and more water-like, and the specific gravity gets lower. Table 3 provides the BCI readings of starter batteries\nWhile BCI (Battery Council International) specifies the specific gravity of a fully charged starter battery at 1.265, battery manufacturers may go for 1.280 and higher. Increasing the specific gravity will move the SoC readings upwards on the look-up table. A higher SG will improve battery performance but shorten battery life because of increased corrosion activity.\nBesides charge level and acid density, a low fluid level will also change the SG. When water evaporates, the SG reading rises because of higher concentration. The battery can also be overfilled, which lowers the number. When adding water, allow time for mixing before taking the SG measurement.\nSpecific gravity varies with battery applications. Deep-cycle batteries use a dense electrolyte with an SG of up to 1.330 to get maximum specific energy; aviation batteries have an SG of about 1.285; traction batteries for forklifts are typically at 1.280; starter batteries come in at 1.265; and stationary batteries have a low specific gravity of 1.225. This reduces corrosion and prolongs life but it decreases the specific energy, or capacity.\nNothing in the battery world is absolute. The specific gravity of fully charged deep-cycle batteries of the same model can range from 1.270 to 1.305; fully discharged, these batteries may vary between 1.097 and 1.201. Temperature is another variable that alters the specific gravity reading. The colder the temperature drops, the higher (more dense) the SG value becomes. Table 4 illustrates the SG gravity of a deep-cycle battery at various temperatures.\nInaccuracies in SG readings can also occur if the battery has stratified, meaning the concentration is light on top and heavy on the bottom(See BU-804c: Water Loss, Acid Stratification and Surface Charge) High acid concentration artificially raises the open circuit voltage, which can fool SoC estimations through false SG and voltage indication. The electrolyte needs to stabilize after charge and discharge before taking the SG reading.\nLaptops, medical equipment and other professional portable devices use coulomb counting to estimate SoC by measuring the in-and-out-flowing current. Ampere-second (As) is used for both charge and discharge. The name “coulomb” was given in honor of Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1736–1806) who is best known for developing Coulomb’s law(See BU-601: How does a Smart Battery Work?)\nWhile this is an elegant solution to a challenging issue, losses reduce the total energy delivered, and what’s available at the end is always less than what had been put in. In spite of this, coulomb counting works well, especially with Li-ion that offer high coulombinc efficiency and low self-discharge. Improvements have been made by also taking aging and temperature-based self-discharge into consideration but periodic calibration is still recommended to bring the “digital battery” in harmony with the “chemical battery.”(See BU-603: How to Calibrate a “Smart” Battery)\nTo overcome calibration, modern fuel gauges use a “learn” function that estimates how much energy the battery delivered on the previous discharge. Some systems also observe the charge time because a faded battery charges more quickly than a good one.\nMakers of advanced BMS claim high accuracies but real life often shows otherwise. Much of the make-believe is hidden behind a fancy readout. Smartphones may show a 100 percent charge when the battery is only 90 percent charged. Design engineers say that the SoC readings on new EV batteries can be off by 15 percent. There are reported cases where EV drivers ran out of charge with a 25 percent SoC reading still on the fuel gauge.\nBattery state-of-charge can also be estimated with impedance spectroscopy using the Spectro™ complex modeling method. This allows taking SoC readings with a steady parasitic load of 30A. Voltage polarization and surface charge do not affect the reading as SoC is measured independently of voltage. This opens applications in automotive manufacturing where some batteries are discharged longer than others during testing and debugging and need charging before transit. Measuring SoC by impedance spectroscopy can also be used for load leveling systems where a battery is continuously under charge and discharge.\nMeasuring SoC independently of voltage also supports dock arrivals and showrooms. Opening the car door applies a parasitic load of about 20A that agitates the battery and falsifies voltage-based SoC measurement. The Spectro™ method helps to identify a low-charge battery from one with a genuine defect.\nSoC measurement by impedance spectroscopy is restricted to a new battery with a known good capacity; capacity must be nailed down and have a non-varying value. While SoC readings are possible with a steady load, the battery cannot be on charge during the test.\nFigure 5 demonstrates the test results of impedance spectroscopy after a parasitic load of 50A is removed from the battery. As expected, the open terminal voltage rises as part of recovery but the Spectro™ readings remains stable. Steady SoC results are also observed after removing charge during when the voltage normalizes as part of polarization.\nBattery is recovering after removing a load. Spectro SoC readings remain stable as the voltage rises.\n[1] Source: Power-Sonic\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "There are more mobile phones in the world than people. No other products have taken off so quickly — faster than the automobile, television, the PC and the Internet. Advancing from a clunky and expensive box in the 1990s to a sleek touchscreen device, the mobile phone still has one troubling component; the battery. Improvements have not been as fast on the battery as with other developments and credit for long runtime goes mostly to advancements in electronics, software and infrastructure.\nThe early Li-ion battery of the 1990s was fragile and unsuitable for high loads. This delayed the use of Li-ion in power tools and electric vehicles. These markets were reserved for the more rugged nickel-cadmium and later nickel-metal-hydride. Today lithium-based systems stand shoulder to shoulder with nickel and lead chemistries. This was made possible with the development of two types of Li-ion systems; the Energy Cell delivering maximum runtime and the Power Cell enabling heavy loading.\nThe Li-ion Energy Cell has a high ampere-hours (Ah) rating for long runtimes and the Panasonic NCR18650B illustrated in Figure 2 is such a product. This cell delivers a capacity of 3,200mAh when discharged at 0.5C or 1.6A. The battery is delicate in that the capacity decreases to 2,300mAh when discharging at 2C or 6.4A. For purpose of analysis, the end-of-charge is set to 3.0V; the cutoff is marked with the red circle. (Ampere-hours with smaller batteries are given usually in milliampere-hours (mAh).)The end-of-discharge cutoff for many devices, including the mobile phone, is often above the designated 3.0V; 3.3V is common. This reduces the usable capacity, especially if discharged at a high current. In many mobile phones, 3.3V refers to zero charge. Some phone may keep operating, others will close shop. Voltage recovery may allow short uses after a rest or when keeping the phone warm.\nFigure 2: Discharge of 3,200mAh Energy CellPanasonic NCR18650B is discharged at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C and 2C. The red circle marks early cutoff at 2C.Cold temperature losses:25°C (77°F) = 100%0°C (32°F) = ~83%–10°C (14°F) = ~66%–20°C (4°F) = ~53%Source: Panasonic\nThe Energy Cell should not be fast-charged at a higher rate than 1C; 0.8C or less is recommended to achieve the specified cycle count. Loading above 1C also adds stress, reflecting in reduced longevity. This cell is ideal for portable computing and mobile phone applications with light to moderate loading requiring long runtimes.\nThe Panasonic UR18650RX Power Cell in Figure 3 has a capacity that is 40% less than the Energy Cell, but has excellent loading capabilities. A 10A (5C) discharge has minimal capacity loss when referring to the 3.0V cutoff. This cell works well for applications requiring heavy load current, such as power tools.\nFigure 3: Discharge of 1,950mAh Power Cell.Panasonic UR18650RX is discharged at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C and 2C and 10A, reaching the 3.0V/cell cut-off line at about 2000mAh in the red circle.Cold temperature losses:25°C (77°F) = 100%0°C (32°F) = ~92%–10°C (14°F) = ~85%–20°C (4°F) = ~80%Source: Panasonic\nFurther advantages of the Power Cell over the Energy Cell are faster charge times and improved low temperature performance. All batteries lose performance when cold but the Li-ion Power Cell overcomes this by providing 92% capacity at 0°C (32°F) and 80% at –20°C (4°F). In comparison, the Energy Cell drops to 83% at 0°C (32°F) and 53% at –20°C (4°F). Never charge Li-ion below freezing as this causes the plating of metallic lithium. This may go unnoticed but can compromise the safety of the battery.The Power Cell achieves superior performance in part by optimizing the surface area of the active materials to enable high current flow with minimal temperature rise. Batteries for mobile phones are crossbred to achieve long runtime and provide the necessary loading capability during active use.\nOne of the major advantages of the mobile phone battery compared to other devices is the use of a single Li-ion cell. This simplifies the safety circuit and does not require cell matching as is necessary with multi-cell packs. This, however, opens the floodgates for broader performance tolerances. Most users would not notice a slightly shorter runtime of a battery that passes at the low-end of the bell curve.Mobile phones come with built-in obsolescence to entice selling a new model when the battery fades or the glass cracks. Other products have stricter requirements in terms of battery longevity and the electric vehicle is an example. EV batteries are guaranteed for eight years; the replacement cost is as much as a regular economy car. Manufacturers can build batteries that last and much of this is achieved by avoiding full charges and complete discharges.Mobile phones are made in large quantity and come with a customized pack. Standard sizes do not apply. Because of size restrictions the choices are most often prismatic or pouch. The popular 18650 cell finds applications in power tools, medical instruments, e-bikes and some EVs.When the state-of-charge (SoC) gets low and the mobile phone approaches the cutoff voltage that is between 3.2–3.5V, the internal resistance of the battery rises. This causes the voltage drop further. The load current on a smartphone ranges from 0.6–1.9A. While talking may still be possible with low charge in close proximity to a tower, GPS and complex computing functions requiring higher operating current and the phone may cut off. Accessing a tower in a fringe area also requires more power than being in line-of-site. A bright display also consumes power. Table 4 estimates typical current consumptions of a modern smartphone.\nFigure 4: Current draw of a mobile phone.Multiple applications are engaged when using our mobile phones that add to a total current draw for a given time. Some applications are momentary; others stay on as housekeeping functions.\nCapacity is the leading health indicator of a battery. Elevated internal resistance is also a failure mode but this is less common. Several methods can be used to estimate the state-of-health (SoH) of a battery.Coulomb counting observes in and outflowing currents of a battery. The theory goes back 250 years when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb established the “Coulomb Rule” that equates one ampere (1A) per second as one coulomb. Coulomb counting measures the energy reserve and should give a fair estimation on the content. This method should be flawless but it has drawbacks. The energy drawn from the battery is always less than what is put in. Tracking errors occur by random use that accumulates over time. Coulomb counting works best when the phone is allowed to run down occasionally to enable calibration.Apps are available to check battery SoH in mobile phones and laptops. This requires current sensing and not all mobile phones provide this feature. Experts examining the app method hint to inaccuracies. Cadex examined 20 batteries that had passed as good when tested with an app that was sold as a commercial product. Testing these batteries with a full cycle, the battery analyzer disclosed capacities ranging from 57–86% with internal resistance fluctuating from 155–368mOhm. With the capacity pass/fail threshold set to 80% and internal resistance to 200mOhm, only 5 of these 20 batteries would qualify for reusable.Some mobile phone manufacturers include software tools that estimate battery SoH, but the readings are not made available to the general public and are only accessible to authorized personnel by security code. This is done for good reason. Making capacity readings available to the users could lead to high warranty claims, especially if the phones are not calibrated and the readings are skewed. A replacement is only mandatory if the battery capacity drops below 80 percent. Keeping the evidence hidden is least disruptive.The most reliable method to check a battery is applying a full discharge cycle. Although time consuming, some refurbishing houses apply this method to get accurate readings with a printed performance report. With automated battery analyzers, the only labor is refilling the stations and the throughput is high. Storefront and small service centers prefer rapid test methods that give reasonable accurate results in just a few minutes. Rapid-testing takes a snapshot of the “chemical battery” rather than relying on the “digital battery” that is often fraught with tracking errors.Most smartphones no longer provide access to the battery, but service centers and refurbishing houses still need to check them. This can be done by opening the devices and connecting the miniature connectors to the FlexStrip interface provided by the battery analyzer. Such work is no longer performed at storefront but by skilled technicians in a service environment.\nReferences: W-Support GmbH, Germany.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/caring-for-your-starter-battery",
        "content": "No other part in a vehicle is as failure-prone as the starter battery. According to ADAC (Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club), battery problems have risen four times between 1996 and 2010. ADAC, Europe’s largest automotive club, says further that each third breakdown involves either a discharged or defective battery. The report published by the German “Motorwelt” in May 2013 also states that only few starter batteries reach the average age of five years, and this applies to all cars. The statistic was derived from more than four million breakdowns that the ADAC car club typically receives in a year. The study only includes newer cars; service-prone vehicles more than six years old were excluded.\nBattery problems are not limited to Germany, a country that produces some of the finest cars. Japan also says that battery breakdown is the largest single complaint among new car owners. Low charge leading to sulfation and acid stratification is a common cause of failure. This is especially apparent in congested Japanese cities where motorists only drive an average of 13km (8 miles) per day. North America may be shielded from these battery problems in part due to long-distance driving.\nBattery manufacturers are exploring the high failure rate and the results are mystifying. A leading Germany battery maker checked 400 starter batteries that had been returned under warranty and found that 200 of them had no problem. Another battery manufacturer revealed that genuine factory faults on warranty returns amount to only 5–7%. Something does not add up.\nWhen Cadillac introduced the starter battery in 1912, the main purpose was to provide starting, lighting and ignition functions. Today, the battery also assists in steering and breaking, besides comfort-adding features such as heating and cooling. Simply opening the driver door causes 20A to flow, not to mention power assisted side doors and tailgates. Start-stop function is a new demand that stretches the flooded lead acid battery beyond its capability. All this leads to capacity loss and premature failure.\nLi-ion starter batteries are now being offered. Their small size and light weight are striking but when asked if these batteries are trouble-free, a German manufacturer of sports cars said that in spite of the high price, the Li-ion starter battery is not without trouble. Longevity is similar to lead acid.\nCapacity is the leading health indicator of a battery. Measured in Ah (ampere-hours) or RC (reserve capacity in minutes 25A discharge), capacity reflects how much energy a battery can hold. CCA (cold cranking amp) is responsible for power delivery and relates to the internal battery resistance. Figure 1 reveals CCA as a free-flowing water tap and capacity as liquid in a container. The intruding rock content demonstrates irreversible capacity loss.\nFigure 1 Graphic illustration of a starter battery\nCCA represents power delivery for good motor cranking; capacity is energy storage illustrated as liquid.\nCapacity fade does not affect cranking noticeably, and most starter batteries perform well until the engine won’t turn one morning. A battery does not die suddenly; it simply runs out of capacity. This is similar to a galloping horse that keeps its spirited performance until the eventual collapse of exhaustion.\nThe large number of warranty returns and high road failure is in part to blame on lack of reliable battery testers. Most testers read only CCA; capacity, the leading health indicator, is unknown. As the capacity diminishes with use and age, the internal resistance remains low. This renders resistive measurements unreliable as a state-of-health and end-of- life indicator. This leads to wrong diagnostics in which a good battery is being replaced in error and one with low capacity is passed, only to fail on the road.\nThe health of a battery cannot be “measured,” only estimated. Much like a doctor examining a patient, or the weatherman forecasting the weather, battery test results are only predictions relating to state-of-health and end-of-life. A dead battery is easy to predict and most testers give 100% accuracy. The challenge comes when measuring a working battery in the 70–100% capacity range. Besides capacity, other attributes also come to play, and these are internal resistance, sulfation and self-discharge. No single device can assess all battery characteristics in a short-test on the fly.\nOne of the early battery testers was the carbon pile. The battery passes if the voltage stays above a set threshold with a load applied for a given time. The carbon pile test reflects lifelike conditions and a skilled technician can attain a reasonably good evaluation, however, the device cannot distinguish between low charge, high internal resistance and lost capacity.\nSingle frequency AC testers inject a 1000-hertz sinusoidal signal or square wave pulses of 80–90 Hertz. These non-invasive methods work on a scalar level by comparing data from a single reference point and measuring the internal resistance. Multiple frequencies have been tried, but the so-called vector method only adds to complexity without significant improvement. Capacity estimation remains beyond reach.\nBattery scientists believe that the future of battery testing lays in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS has been around for many years but high equipment cost, long test times and the need for trained experts deciphering data have kept this technology in laboratories. Figures 2, 3 and 4 illustrate the most common battery test methods in use today.\nFigure 2: Load Test applies a load while reading the voltage. Confirms functionality but cannot read low charge, high internal resistance and low capacity.\nFigure 3: Load Test applies an AC signal to measure internal battery resistance. Testers are non-invasive, fast, stay cool, but cannot estimate capacity.\nFigure 4: EIS scans the battery with frequencies. Nyquist plot needs expert to decode. Long test times reserves EIS mostly to research labs.\nScanning a battery and plotting a Nyquist curve with EIS is relatively simple; the complexity arises in evaluating the data. Cadex took the EIS technology a level higher and developed multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy or Spectro™ in short.\nBuilt in an elegant handheld device, the Spectro CA-12 scans the battery with a 20–2000 Hertz signal as if to take the topology of a landscape. The heart of the system is the algorithm that compiles 40 million transactions and delivers CCA and capacity readings in 15 seconds. The CCA prediction is accurate to+/-5%, but its strength lays in capacity estimation. The prediction on capacity is accurate to +/-20%.\nUsers will ask for better capacity predictions and improvements in matrices will achieve this in part. The user must appreciate that a battery fault can only be diagnosed if measurable indicators are present. For unknown reasons, reversible (soft) sulfation does not display readable symptoms and the battery receives a clean bill of health. Only permanent (hard) sulfation that can no longer be corrected agrees with the result. A parallel can be made with a patient who has a unique condition that defies medical instruments.\nAs with all advanced systems, Spectro™ requires infrastructure and these are matrices, also known as pattern recognition algorithm. A matrix is a multi-dimensional lookup table against which readings are compared. Text recognition, fingerprint identification and visual imaging operate on a similar principle. Cadex is in the process to build a matrix library that includes various battery types. Generic matrices are most practical as these service a broad range of batteries by sorting on a capacity threshold.\nBattery diagnostics and monitoring have not advanced as rapidly as the battery industry desires but incremental progress is being made. Batteries are complex beasts and test methods must distinguish between low charge and faded capacity, symptoms that are different to the outside but have similar diagnostics qualities. Battery characteristics also change after charging and prolonged storage.\nCapacity is the leading health indicator that determines the end-of-battery-life. A starter battery should be replaced when the capacity drops below 40%. With the resistance-based method, the capacity is unknown, and many batteries may be replaced on a false assumption. There is also resistance to replace a battery that still cranks but is dangerously low on capacity. A battery does not die suddenly but runs out of capacity, and this occurs mostly during a cold spell. Driving with an expired battery is like a corroded bridge that had been closed to traffic but still stands.\nGerman luxury car makers want to remove the word breakdown from the dictionary. Capacity-based diagnostics will assist in this effort that will also lower statistical records of ADAC road assistance. Improved battery testing will also benefit non-automotive industries. Capacity estimation of UPS batteries will lead to better valuations and possible longer service lives. Extended life will benefit the pocket book and protect the environment as fewer batteries will be discarded.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) has identical charge characteristics to Lithium-ion but with lower terminal voltages. In many ways, LFP also resembles lead acid which enables some compatibility with 6V and 12V packs but with different cell counts. While lead acid offers low-cost with reliable and safe power, LFP provides a higher cycle count and delivers more than twice the capacity of lead acid. These advantages with reduced size and weight compensate for the higher purchase price of the LFP pack. (See also BU-808: How to Prolong Lithium-based batteries.)\nBoth lead-acid and lithium-based batteries use voltage limit charge; BU-403 describes charge requirements for lead acid while BU-409 outlines charging for lithium-based batteries.\nCompatibility of a 12V pack between LFP and lead acid is made possible by replacing the six 2V lead acid cells with four 3.2V LFP cells. While the voltage total is similar, the lead acid charger applies a float charge when the battery is fully charged to compensate for self-discharge and parasitic loads, a feature that lithium chemistry cannot tolerate.\nOptimal stress with lithium batteries occurs at high voltage as the battery reaches full charge. The high-voltage stage during charge should be kept short and the charge currents must be completely turned off when the battery is fully charged. Maintaining lithium-based batteries with a float charge would shorten the life span and even compromise safety on some lithium battery systems. A Battery Management System (BMS) for LFP packs may include built-in provisions to protect the battery when serviced with a lead acid charger.\nTo compensate for parasitic loads and self-discharge, some Li-ion chargers apply a recharge when the terminal voltage decreases to a set level. Table 1 illustrates recommended voltage levels for lead acid and lithium-based cells. Table 2 transfers these voltages into a 12 volt pack. The values are nominal. Higher or lower values may be chosen to improve performance or prolong battery life.\n1 2.30V to 2.45V; See BU-403: Changing Lead Acid\n2 Commonly used for UPS; float charge voltages for automotive may be higher\n3 Prolonged float charge on LFP batteries will shorten battery life\n4 Voltage may vary according to architecture\n5 LFP will not be fully charged but has more capacity than lead acid\n6 Device may terminate end of discharge at higher voltage levels to assure power\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Batteries will eventually die, but when and how?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/batteries-will-eventually-die-but-when-and-how",
        "content": "Discovering Damage before Danger Arises with the Three-prong Battery Test\nThe media is quick to report mishaps with lithium-ion batteries. A failed Li-ion gets higher attention than an accident with an older battery chemistry. Electric hoverboards have been recalled because of battery fires; in 2006 Sony recalled laptop batteries, and in 2012/2013 the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded to redesign the battery enclosure to withstand a fire. These calamities occurred after the battery had passed UL safety tests; instabilities surfaced in field use. With the proliferation of lithium-ion batteries and not knowing when and how they will die, safety must be addressed as part of work-force-to-retirement. Lithium-ion is safe but with millions of industrial and consumer applications, failures will happen. The Sony recall was a one-in-200,000 breakdown caused by microscopic metal particles coming in contact with other parts in the battery cell, leading to a short circuit. Battery manufacturers strive to minimize the presence of such particles; however, assembly techniques make the elimination of dust a challenge. Modern cells with ultra-thin separators of 21µm (21-thousandth of an mm) are more susceptible to impurities than older designs with heavier separators and lower Ah ratings. While the classic 1,350mAh cell in the 18650 package could tolerate a nail penetration; the energy-dense 3,400mAh turns into a firework when performing the same test.There are two basic types of battery failures. One is the one-in-10-million incident involving a manufacturing flaw that may lead to a recall. The more difficult failure is a random event like being hit by a meteor. Such a breakdown does not point to a design flaw but may be stress related, such as charging at sub-freezing temperature, exposure to heat or excess vibration. Some applications overstress the battery and hobby gadgets, hoverboards and drones are examples. An analogy is placing a souped-up sports car engine into a heavy truck. The small engine won’t last; neither will a wrongly chosen Li-ion battery.Most battery failures leading to disintegration start with a mild electrical short that goes unnoticed. This can be an uneven separator with dry areas leading to poor conductivity and developing a heat spot. Fast charging at cold temperatures promotes dendrite formation, so does storing Li-ion below 1.5V/cell for more than a week. The stress events promote self-discharge that can lead to a destructive failure.What is especially frustrating for Li-ion manufacturers and users is not being aware of a pending breakdown. The battery performs normally because the internal stresses are disguised. This is analogous to a steel beam that suddenly breaks under repeated heavy loads. Load bearing is well documented and the failure point is known, but random defects still occur due to metal fatigue or a structural fault. Once broken, the damage is finite and cannot be rewound for replay. This also happens with a destroyed battery; however there is an early prediction: elevated self-discharge. As the condition of a battery deteriorates, the self-discharge increases, which can develop into a sizable current between the electrodes. Similar to a seemingly harmless water leak in a faulty hydro dam that can develop into a torrent and take a structure down, so can also high self-discharge build up heat and damage the separator, leading to an electrical short. The temperature will quickly reach 500°C (932°F), at which point the cell catches fire or explodes. The thermal runaway that occurs is known as “venting with flame; “rapid disassembly” is the preferred term by the battery industry.\nThe Technical University of München in Germany stressed Li-ion cells by applying a deep discharge and storing them in a shorted condition. Figure 1 demonstrates the self-discharge of a new Li-ion cell, one that underwent forced deep discharges and a cell that was fully discharged, shorted for 14 days, and then recharged. In normal use, BMS and protection circuits would prevent such conditions to occur.Figure 1: Self-discharge of new and stressed Li-ion cells. Cells stressed by deep discharges and kept at 0V exhibit a higher self-discharge than a new cell.Source: TU München\nBattery research places most of its attention on birth-to-graduation. Equally important is workforce-to-retirement, a topic that tends to get ignored. While regulatory approvals for new batteries are tough, once accepted the officials wash their hands and place the responsibility of maintaining the battery to the user. That’s when battery problems begin. Rules on the usage of a battery are vague and the operator may ask, “How much capacity is sufficient for reliable operation? How often should I check the battery? At what capacity should I replace the pack?”\nA bio-med whistle-blower in charge of medical instruments said, “Batteries are the most abused components. Staff care little about them and only do the bare minimum. References to battery maintenance are vague and hidden inside service manuals.” AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instruments) rates battery management as one of the top 10 challenges, and a US FDA survey says that up to 50% of issues in hospitals are battery related.Batteries should receive the same treatment as a critical part in a machine or an aircraft where wear and tear falls under strict maintenance guidelines. Batteries are given special privileges and are labeled “uncontrollable.” This immunity excuses them from undergoing regular inspections, but this does not need to be so. Batteries can and should be checked and this is possible with the three-prong test. The three-prong battery test examines three most critical functions that include:\nMeasuring capacity by applying a full discharge cycle provides the most reliable assessment. This method is most effective with portable batteries and a periodic analysis ensures that the batteries are kept within an acceptable performance range. With smart batteries, FCC (full charge capacity) can be used to estimate state-of-health (SoH). FCC is a coulomb count that remembers how much energy the battery received and delivered previously. Relying on digital reference readings reduces the need to cycle but any tracking mechanism loses accuracy over time and this can be restored with periodic calibration. Calibration consists of a full charge/discharge/charge cycle. Larger batteries are normally not cycled because it is time-consuming and stresses the battery. That’s where non-invasive test methods come in. A number of rapid-test methods are available that assess the chemical battery by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and other methods. No rapid-test is bang-on and the accuracy correlates to symptoms received and the sophistication of algorithms employed.Battery analyzers became popular in the 1980s and 1990s to restore nickel-cadmium batteries that were affected by “memory.” Today these workhorses are employed to analyze a broad range of batteries as part of fleet management to assure system integrity. Battery analyzers act as gatekeepers to retire packs when the capacity falls below a set performance criteria; 80% is the typically accepted end-of-life threshold.To satisfy the three-prong battery test, modern battery analyzers should also measure the internal resistance and self-discharge; functions that can be integrated into the test procedure without human intervention. The self-discharge test works as follows:On program completion, a battery analyzer or charger measures the battery terminal voltage, known as OCV (open circuit voltage), as the Li-ion battery rests. Voltage neutralization after charge or discharge takes about two hours after which valid self-discharge readings can be taken. Monitoring continues as long as the Li-ion battery rests in the device. Self-discharge values are shown as a percentage of the rated Ah and should be about 5% per month for a good battery including protection circuit. More research will be needed to know what level of self-discharge is acceptable, what raises concern, and when a battery should be quarantined.Monitoring self-discharge should also be included in a battery management system (BMS). This is especially critical for wheeled mobility where batteries undergo harsh environmental stresses caused by temperature extremes and vibration. Self-discharge should also be checked in devices that prepare Li-ion packs for air shipment by discharging them to 30% SoC. Excessively high self-discharge caused by internal damage leading to a possible fire during transport would clearly be identified beforehand.The longer test times required to measure self-discharge is a drawback. Battery analyzers and chargers offering this feature will complete the capacity and internal resistance assessment in the anticipated time with the green light indicating readiness for service. If, however, the pack is left in the device for a few extra hours, such as an overnight service, the self-discharge readings will be added. No added logistics is needed to complete the three-prong battery test, just time.\nThe compounded growth for Li-ion batteries from 2014 to 2019 is said to be 22% per annum. Batteries are getting larger and the saying goes, “Small children, small problems; big children, big problems.” As mom and dad need to sharpen their parenting skills with teenagers in the house, so also do larger Li-ion batteries require better diagnostics and demand tighter safety regulations than smaller packs of the past.\n“How will large Li-ion systems age under different environment conditions?” is an open question. Will they die peacefully or end life with a bang after years of hard work? Cadex is studying work-force-to-retirement by developing BMS, chargers and analyzers that include safety checks. Fundamental to this is the three-prong battery test revealing the key battery functions of capacity, internal resistance and self-discharge, which are responsible for runtime, power and safety.Of large importance is also cell balance, a reading that is available with many SMBus batteries. The capacity of serially connected cells should be within +/-2.5%. Batteries with well-matched cells perform better and live longer than those that have become uneven. Identifying a battery with CAUTION should the cells get out of balance provides an additional safety check and hints to end-of-life because of reduced performance.Battery service and test devices will soon communicate to the cloud by wireless connectivity to make battery state-of-health transparent to the user. Such a system will allow the operator to simply call up all packs with a low capacity for replacement at budget time. Gaining access to this information lowers operational risk as the state-of-health of each pack is known. This enables a full service life for each battery, lowering operational costs and protecting the environment because fewer packs are discarded prematurely. Knowing battery SoH also lowers repairs as the battery is the cause of many malfunctions.\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-807a-effect-of-zapping",
        "content": "Remote control (RC) enthusiasts are experimenting with all imaginable methods to maximize battery performance. The electric motor of a model race car draws 30A for about 4 minutes delivered by a 7.2V battery. This is over 200W of power, a large amount for a small battery. NiCd batteries often energize these devices, and a technique that seems to enhance the power is zapping NiCd cells with a very high pulse current. This is said to increase the cell voltage slightly and generate more power.\nAccording to experts, zapping works best with standard NiCd cells. NiMHs have been tried but they do not produce consistent results. Nor can zapping be applied to Li-ion. Companies specializing in zapping use a very high quality NiCd cell from Japan, and the sub-C is the most popular size. The factory handpicks the cells, and they come with a unique label in a fully discharged state. When measuring the empty cell, the open circuit voltage should read between 1.11 and 1.12V. If the voltage is lower than 1.06V, then the cell is suspect and zapping does not enhance the performance.\nTo zap a NiCd battery, charge a 47,000µF capacitor to 90V and apply the raw power directly across a single NiCd cell of 1.2V. After the shock treatment, cycle the cell and zap it once more. Experts say that once a cell is treated and used in service, further zapping will no longer improve performance, nor will it regenerate a weak cell.\nThe voltage increase on a successfully zapped battery is between 20 and 40mV when loaded with 30A. According to experts, the voltage gain is permanent, but there is a small drop of the gained voltage with usage and time.\nThere are no apparent side effects from zapping, however, battery manufacturers remain silent about this treatment. No scientific explanations are available as to why zapping improves battery performance other than the gained voltage and the apparent lower internal resistance. There is little information available regarding the longevity of the cells after the treatment.\nAnother method to improve NiCd batteries is through a recondition program. Tests performed at the Cadex laboratories reveal a permanent capacity gain of about 7 percent when servicing new NiCd with recondition, a program that lowers the battery voltage to 0.4V/cell on a secondary discharge(See BU-807: How to Restore Nickel-based Batteries) This capacity gain is not fully understood other than to assume that the battery improves through additional formatting. Another explanation is the removal of early memory. Since new batteries are stored with some charge, the self-discharge that occurs during storage may contribute to the buildup of crystalline formation, which recondition reverses.\nThe interest for RC enthusiasts is shifting to high-performance Li-ion. The question is asked: “Does Li-ion perform as well as NiCd?” Some experts say no, even when choosing the highest-performing Li-ion. NiCd remains the most rugged rechargeable battery; it is also the only battery that can be ultra-fast charged with minimal stress. When the German car manufacturers switched from NiCd to Li-ion for their high precision power tools, the battery specifications needed to be relaxed because Li-ion could not meet the NiCd requirements.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Keeping track of batteries can be difficult, especially when encountering continuously changing battery types and observing periodic maintenance needs. To assist, several manufacturers of battery analyzers are offering software to enable PC interface. While a PC is helpful for battery service, the available software is often not refined enough to satisfy most market requirements. Describing the features of software packages is difficult, if not outright boring. For this reason, this paper takes BatteryShop™ by Cadex as the example of a fully functioning, multi-tasking battery maintenance system. Developed during the last 10 years, BatteryShop™ is a mature product that meets today's battery service requirements. BatteryShop™ works in conjunction with Cadex C7000 Series battery analyzers. Although the analyzers work as stand-alone units, the software overrides the analyzers when connected to a PC. BatteryShop™ is equally proficient in supporting one analyzer or a fully extended system of 120 units. To simplify the service of batteries, BatteryShop™ includes a database of over 2000 batteries for wireless communications, portable computing, medical, broadcast and defense. The listing includes the battery configuration codes, known as C-Codes. The newer battery listings also contain the QuickTest™ matrix to enable rapid testing. The user can extend the library by adding new models or downloading the updates from www.cadex.com. The Internet allows sharing the C-Codes and QuickTest™ matrices with the global battery community. In addition, battery manufacturers can prepare and publish the service parameters before releasing a new battery. To service a battery, the user selects the battery model from the database and clicks the mouse. The PC sets the analyzer to the correct parameters, ready to service the battery. Programming the analyzer by scanning the battery model is also possible. Figure 1 illustrates a typical setup with two analyzers.\nSoftware is commonly written to accommodate a broad range of applications, even though a customer may never use more than one function. BatteryShop™ is designed to service cell phone batteries at storefronts, check batteries in large repair centers, assist in the scheduled maintenance of fleet batteries, and tend to engineers in research labs. Here are a few examples how the PC software can be used:\nWhen testing a cell phone battery at point-of-sale with BatteryShop™, the service clerk selects the battery from the database, clicks the mouse and connects the pack. To simplify the selection, photo images of the pack can also be shown on the monitor. The service programs range from QuickTest™ to check a battery in three minutes, Boost to wake up a seemingly dead battery, Prime to prepare a new battery and verify its performance, Charge to fast-charge, and Auto to exercise and recondition a battery. Systems such as these prevent the liberal replacement of batteries returned by frivolous customers who complain about reoccurring problems with a handset. Battery software can also be integrated into rapid test stations capable of examining the basic functions of a complete cell phone at storefronts. Willtek Communications offers such a system. With the use of these test instruments, only handsets with genuine problems are sent in for repair. Cell phone dealers have indicated that less that 20% of cell phones brought in for service have real problems with the handset or the battery. The cost savings by pre-testing the handsets and batteries are considerable.\nNot all batteries are tested at point-of-sale. Many cell phone manufactures use strategically placed service centers to repair handsets and batteries. A large service center may repair as many as 50,000 units per month. The database for such an organization can be tailored to include only those batteries that are being handled by that organization. The test results can be used for statistical analyses or sent to a central location for evaluation. Enabling access to vital test information allows battery manufacturers to correct recurring battery problems quickly and effectively.\nService software is especially helpful in tracking the maintenance requirements of fleet batteries. All packs are first marked with a unique battery ID number. The ID number is printed on a label in bar code format and permanently attached to the battery. BatteryShop™ generates these labels. To perform the scheduled maintenance, the user scans the battery ID and the PC automatically configures to the analyzer to the correct setting. On completion of the service, the battery test results are stored in the database under the assigned battery ID number. All references to the battery in terms of vendor information, purchase date, custodian, maintenance schedules, performance history and planned replacement are available with a click of the mouse.\nBattery service software assists battery manufacturers and pack assemblers in terms of life cycle testing, batch checking for quality control and verifying warranty claims. Chemistry, voltage and current setting can be entered manually through the PC. Charge and discharge voltages are displayed in real-time graphics. The graphs also include battery temperature and internal resistance readings that are recoded during charge and discharge cycles. All test data can be stored for future reference.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/the-high-power-lithium-ion",
        "content": "NOTE: This article has been archived. Please read our new \"Types of Lithium-ion\" for an updated version.\nMost lithium-ion batteries for portable applications are cobalt-based. The system consists of a cobalt oxide positive electrode (cathode) and a graphite carbon in the negative electrode (anode). One of the main advantages of the cobalt-based battery is its high energy density. Long run-time makes this chemistry attractive for cell phones, laptops and cameras.\nLithium-ion has not yet reached full maturity and the technology is continually improving. The anode in today's cells is made up of a graphite mixture and the cathode is a combination of lithium and other choice metals. It should be noted that all materials in a battery have a theoretical energy density. With lithium-ion, the anode is well optimized and little improvements can be gained in terms of design changes. The cathode, however, shows promise for further enhancements. Battery research is therefore focusing on the cathode material. Another part that has potential is the electrolyte. The electrolyte serves as a reaction medium between the anode and the cathode. The battery industry is making incremental capacity gains of 8-10% per year. This trend is expected to continue. This, however, is a far cry from Moore's Law that specifies a doubling of transistors on a chip every 18 to 24 months. Translating this increase to a battery would mean a doubling of capacity every two years. Instead of two years, lithium-ion has doubled its energy capacity in 10 years.\nToday's lithium-ion comes in many \"flavours\" and the differences in the composition are mostly related to the cathode material. Table 1 below summarizes the most commonly used lithium-ion on the market today. For simplicity, we summarize the chemistries into four groupings, which are Cobalt, Manganese, NCM and Phosphate.\nChemical name\nMaterial\nAbbreviation\nShort form\nNotes\nLithium Cobalt Oxide1Also Lithium Cobalate or lithium-ion-cobalt)\nLiCoO2(60% Co)\nLCO\nLi-cobalt\nHigh capacity; for cell phone laptop, camera\nLithiumManganese Oxide1Also Lithium Manganateor lithium-ion-manganese\nLiMn2O4\nLMO\nLi-manganese, or spinel\nMost safe; lower capacity than Li-cobalt but high specific power and long life.\nPower tools,e-bikes, EV, medical, hobbyist.\nLithiumIron Phosphate1\nLiFePO4\nLFP\nLi-phosphate\nLithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide1, also lithium-manganese-cobalt-oxide\nLiNiMnCoO2(10–20% Co)\nNMC\nNMC\nLithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide1\nLiNiCoAlO29% Co)\nNCA\nNCA\nGaining importancein electric powertrain and grid storage\nLithium Titanate2\nLi4Ti5O12\nLTO\nLi-titanate\nTable 1: Reference names for Li-ion batteries.We willuse the short form when appropriate.\n1  Cathode material\n2  Anode material\nThe cobalt-based lithium-ion appeared first in 1991, introduced by Sony. This battery chemistry gained quick acceptance because of its high energy density. Possibly due to lower energy density, spinel-based lithium-ion had a slower start. When introduced in 1996, the world demanded longer runtime above anything else. With the need for high current rate on many portable devices, spinel has now moved to the frontline and is in hot demand. The requirements are so great that manufacturers producing these batteries are unable to meet the demand. This is one of the reasons why so little advertising is done to promote this product. E-One Moli Energy (Canada) is a leading manufacturer of the spinel lithium-ion in cylindrical form. They are specializing in the 18650 and 26700 cell formats. Other major players of spinel-based lithium-ion are Sanyo, Panasonic and Sony.\nSony is focusing on the nickel-cobalt manganese (NCM) version. The cathode incorporates cobalt, nickel and manganese in the crystal structure that forms a multi-metal oxide material to which lithium is added. The manufacturer offers a range of different products within this battery family, catering to users that either needs high energy density or high load capability. It should be noted that these two attributes could not be combined in one and the same package; there is a compromise between the two. Note that the NCM charges to 4.10V/cell, 100mV lower than cobalt and spinel. Charging this battery chemistry to 4.20V/cell would provide higher capacities but the cycle life would be cut short. Instead of the customary 800 cycles achieved in a laboratory environment, the cycle count would be reduced to about 300.The newest addition to the lithium-ion family is the A123 System in which nano-phosphate materials are added in the cathode. It claims to have the highest power density in W/kg of a commercially available lithium-ion battery. The cell can be continuously discharged to 100% depth-of-discharge at 35C and can endure discharge pulses as high as 100C. The phosphate-based system has a nominal voltage of about 3.3V/cell and peak charge voltage is 3.60V. This is lower than the cobalt-based lithium-ion and the battery will require a designated charger. Valance Technology was the first to commercialize the phosphate-based lithium-ion and their cells are sold under the Saphionâ name.In Figure 4 we compare the energy density (Wh/kg) of the three lithium-ion chemistries and place them against the traditional lead acid, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal-hydride. One can see the incremental improvement of Manganese and Phosphate over older technologies. Cobalt offers the highest energy density but is thermally less stable and cannot deliver high load currents.\nEnergy Density (Wh/kg) is a measure of how much energy a battery can hold. The higher the energy density, the longer the runtime will be. Lithium-ion with cobalt cathodes offer the highest energy densities. Typical applications are cell phones, laptops and digital cameras.Power Density (W/kg) indicates how much power a battery can deliver on demand. The focus is on power bursts, such as drilling through heavy steel, rather than runtime. Manganese and phosphate-based lithium-ion, as well as nickel-based chemistries, are among the best performers. Batteries with high power density are used for power tools, medical devices and transportation systems. An analogy between energy and power densities can be made with a water bottle. The size of the bottle is the energy density, while the opening denotes the power density. A large bottle can carry a lot of water, while a large opening can pore it quickly. The large container with a wide mouth is the best combination.\nFor the last 10 years or so, the nominal voltage of lithium-ion was known to be 3.60V/cell. This was a rather handy figure because it made up for three nickel-based batteries (1.2V/cell) connected in series. Using the higher cell voltages for lithium-ion reflects in better watt/hours readings on paper and poses a marketing advantage, however, the equipment manufacturer will continue assuming the cell to be 3.60V.The nominal voltage of a lithium-ion battery is calculated by taking a fully charged battery of about 4.20V, fully discharging it to about 3.00V at a rate of 0.5C while measuring the average voltage. Because of the lower internal resistance, the average voltage of a spinel system will be higher than that of the cobalt-based equivalent. Pure spinel has the lowest internal resistance and the nominal cell voltage is 3.80V. The exception again is the phosphate-based lithium-ion. This system deviates the furthest from the conventional lithium-ion system\nBatteries live longer if treated in a gentle manner. High charge voltages, excessive charge rate and extreme load conditions have a negative effect on battery life. The longevity is often a direct result of the environmental stresses applied. The following guidelines suggest ways to prolong battery life.-The time at which the battery stays at 4.20/cell should be as short as possible. Prolonged high voltage promotes corrosion, especially at elevated temperatures. Spinel is less sensitive to high voltage.-3.92V/cell is the best upper voltage threshold for cobalt-based lithium-ion. Charging batteries to this voltage level has been shown to double cycle life. Lithium-ion systems for defense applications make use of the lower voltage threshold. The negative is a much lower capacity.-The charge current of Li-ion should be moderate (0.5C for cobalt-based lithium-ion). The lower charge current reduces the time in which the cell resides at 4.20V. A 0.5C charge only adds marginally to the charge time over 1C because the topping charge will be shorter. A high current charge tends to push the voltage into voltage limit prematurely.-Do not discharge lithium-ion too deeply. Instead, charge it frequently. Lithium-ion does not have memory problems like nickel-cadmium batteries. No deep discharges are needed for conditioning.-Do not charge lithium-ion at or below freezing temperature. Although accepting charge, an irreversible plating of metallic lithium will occur that compromises the safety of the pack.\nNot only does a lithium-ion battery live longer with a slower charge rate; moderate discharge rates also help. Figure 5 shows the cycle life as a function of charge and discharge rates. Observe the improved laboratory performance on a charge and discharge rate of 1C compared to 2 and 3C.\nBattery experts agree that the longevity of lithium-ion is shortened by other factors than charge and discharge rates. Even though incremental improvements can be achieved with careful use, our environment and the services required are not always conducive for optimal battery life. In this respect, the battery behaves much like us humans - we cannot always live a life that caters to achieve maximum life span.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Batteries can be charged manually with a power supply featuring user-adjustable voltage and current limiting. I stress manual because charging needs the know-how and can never be left unattended; charge termination is not automated. Because of difficulties in detecting full charge with nickel-based batteries, I recommend charging only lead and lithium-based batteries manually.\nBefore connecting the battery, calculate the charge voltage according to the number of cells in series, and then set the desired voltage and current limit. To charge a 12-volt lead acid battery (six cells) to a voltage limit of 2.40V, set the voltage to 14.40V (6 x 2.40). Select the charge current according to battery size. For lead acid, this is between 10 and 30 percent of the rated capacity. A 10Ah battery at 30 percent charges at about 3A; the percentage can be lower. An 80Ah starter battery may charge at 8A. (A 10 percent charge rate is equal to 0.1C.)\nObserve the battery temperature, voltage and current during charge. Charge only at ambient temperatures in a well-ventilated room. Once the battery is fully charged and the current has dropped to 3 percent of the rated Ah, the charge is completed. Disconnect the charge. Also disconnect the charge after 16–24 hours if the current has bottomed out and cannot go lower; high self-discharge (soft electrical short) can prevent the battery from reaching the low saturation level. If you need float charge for operational readiness, lower the charge voltage to about 2.25V/cell.\nYou can also use the power supply to equalize a lead acid battery by setting the charge voltage 10 percent higher than recommended. The time in overcharge is critical and must be carefully observed. (See BU-404: What is Equalizing Charge)\nA power supply can also reverse sulfation. Set the charge voltage above the recommended level, adjust the current limiting to the lowest practical value and observe the battery voltage. A totally sulfated lead acid may draw very little current at first and as the sulfation layer dissolves, the current will gradually increase. Elevating the temperature and placing the battery on an ultrasound vibrator may also help in the process. If the battery does not accept a charge after 24 hours, restoration is unlikely. (See BU-804b: Sulfation and How to Prevent it)\nLithium-ion charges similarly to lead acid and you can also use the power supply but exercise extra caution. Check the full charge voltage, which is commonly 4.20V/cell, and set the threshold accordingly. Make certain that none of the cells connected in series exceeds this voltage. (The protection circuit in a commercial pack does this.) Full charge is reached when the cell(s) reach 4.20V/cell voltage and the current drops to 3 percent of the rated current, or has bottomed out and cannot go down further. Once fully charged, disconnect the battery. Never allow a cell to dwell at 4.20V for more than a few hours. (See BU-409: Charging Lithium-ion)\nPlease note that not all Li-ion batteries charge to the voltage threshold of 4.20V/cell. Lithium iron phosphate typically charges to the cut-off voltage of 3.65V/cell and lithium-titanate to 2.85V/cell. Some Energy Cells may accept 4.30V/cell and higher. It is important to observe these voltage limits. (See BU-205: Types of Lithium-ion)\nCharging nickel-based batteries with a power supply is challenging because the full-charge detection is rooted in a voltage signature that varies with the applied charge current. If you must charge NiCd and NiMH with a regulated power supply, use the temperature rise on a 0.3–1C rapid charge as an indication of full charge. When charging at a low current, estimate the level of remaining charge and calculate the charge time. An empty 2Ah NiMH will charge in about 3 hours at 750–1,000mA. The trickle charge, also known as maintenance charge, must be reduced to 0.05C. (See BU-407: Charging Nickel-cadmium; BU-408: Charging Nickel-metal-hydride)\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Diagnostic Battery Management",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/diagnostic-battery-management",
        "content": "The super battery, when ready, will be incomplete without diagnostic management. Batteries have a defined lifespan; some die early, others may go with a bang. Tightening regulations will do little to improve performance and safety. Battery care begins by observing user-induced stress and aging symptoms. This paper introduces Diagnostic Battery Management (DBM); test methods that monitor the state-of-health (SoH) of a battery from work-force-to-retirement. DBM advances the battery to a reliable, safe, cost effective and environmentally sustainable travel companion.\nA battery has the fundamental flaw of not knowing its performance. The outer appearance does not reveal its condition; a battery looks the same when fully charged or empty, new or old and in need of replacement. A car tire, in comparison, distorts when low on air and indicates end-of-life when the treads are worn. With the growing battery population and larger batteries packs, attention must shift to better diagnostics to improve reliability, improve safety and attain environmental sustainability.\nPerhaps batteries are not given their due respect. Many engineers still treat the battery and charger as an afterthought in the long design process; for many the charger is seen as unnecessary baggage. In the 1970s, the world had computers but little software — shared software changed this. Today, the world revolves around the battery, but it lacks management. An industrial revolution in batteries is on the horizon.\nThe battery is well suited for portable and wearable devices such as smartphones, laptops and pace makers. Fossil fuel with its polluting and noisy internal combustion engine (ICE) is reserved for heavy vehicles, airplanes and ocean-going ships. These two energy systems have little in common; competing against fossil fuel with a net calorific value that is 100 times higher than the battery secures the strong position. Conversely, petroleum cannot match the battery that is clean, quiet and has an instantaneous start-up with the touch of a switch. An ICE in a mobile phone or as pace maker would be unthinkable.\nWith the advent of the electric vehicle, the battery is advancing into a field what was ICE territory. Similar intrusions are seen with boats and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones). Time will tell how far the battery can go in conquering new grounds, and this rests on the anticipated improvements that will be made. Isidor Buchmann, founder of Cadex and author of BatteryUniversity.com predicts that, “Every 1 percent improvement in battery performance will widen battery applications by 10 percent.”\nThe battery is increasingly being promoted as a green energy solution to liberate society from the dependency on fossil fuels. While this is a noble endeavor, the battery is not yet mature enough to fill this important role. Pushing the boundaries reminds us of its many limitations of being an electrochemical power source that is slow to fill, holds limited energy, runs for a time like a wind-up toy and has a relatively short life span before quitting without warning.\nCapacity is the leading health indicator of a battery. It represents energy storage that governs the runtime and predicts the end of life when low. Other characteristics affecting battery health are internal resistance that limits the current, as well as self-discharge that hints to a mechanical defect when high. It is believed that elevated self-discharge is the precursor of Li-ion fires. Older nickel-based batteries also have high self-discharge but this is not known to compromise safety. The pack may only go flat overnight.\nA common method to evaluate battery capacity is by coulomb counting. This goes back 250 years when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb established the Coulomb Rules. Coulomb counting provides capacity estimation by measuring in-and-outflowing energies. The readings are stored in the smart battery and correlate with capacity, but inaccuracies develop with random usage. Calibration or a deep discharge in the device with a full charge corrects the tracking error.\nBatteries often include a fuel gauge to indicate the charge level. While this is useful to predict the remaining runtime, the capacity is not shown and the user will ask: “Charge of what?” The fuel gauge always shows 100 percent after a full charge, even if the capacity has faded to 50 percent. State-of-charge readings are only useful if the battery condition is known, as is the case with a personal battery. Charge does not mean “able.”\nManufacturers specify the runtime of a device with a perfect battery delivering 100 percent capacity. This condition is short-lived because of fading. Regulatory approvals are tough but once rubber stamped, officials wash their hands and pass all responsibilities to the user. Entering workforce-to-retirement requires battery diagnostics that monitors capacity loss, identifies anomalies and predicts when a battery should be replaced. These services are seldom done because suitable technologies are not readily available; nor can the battery be removed for lengthy testing.\nCadex has been studying battery health for over a decade by analyzing symptoms. This led to the development of algorithms to estimate battery capacity as part of rapid-testing. The algorithms are derived by scanning thousands of batteries at various state-of-health conditions and then developing a test procedure that takes a snapshot of the chemical battery for the purpose of evaluation.\nRapid-test developments form the building blocks for Diagnostic Battery Management. These algorithms can be integrated into battery chargers, analyzers and monitoring devices. Test results can be shown on the charger and stored in a web-based application called Battery Embassy. Each service updates the status to provide real-time supervision as part of quality control and risk management in batteries.\nA database requires a reference and the serial number in a smart battery serves as embedded ID. With test data on hand, the fleet supervisor can now do budgetary queries by calling up batteries with capacities below 80 percent for replacement.\nTo assure reliability, device manufacturers often mandate battery replacement by a fixed date stamp. In order to accommodate batteries with low and high usage, a two-year replacement is commanded. While simple, operation is cost-prohibitive and burdens the environment as most batteries are replaced prematurely. A quality Li-ion battery is good for 5 years typically.\nBio-med technicians have discovered that the capacity of most batteries in medical instruments is still above 90% when the date stamp expires. Dr. Imre Gyuk, Energy Storage Program Manager of the U.S. Department of Energy, reported that “every year roughly one million usable lithium-ion batteries are sent for recycling.”\nAs wasteful as the two-year data stamp policy may appear, it does not solve the battery problem. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) survey says that, “up to 50 percent of service calls in hospitals surveyed relate to battery issues.” Healthcare professionals at AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instruments) report “battery management emerged as a top 10 medical device challenge.” A battery seminar that was organized by the FDA to improve battery reliability in healthcare came up with these concerns:\nBattery users must become better custodians of this marvelous energy source. Developing a super battery is incomplete without addressing the problems identified by the FDA and other industries. With a predicted annual growth in battery usage of 20 percent, environmental concerns must also be addressed. This is where embedded diagnostics will play an important role. The ability to utilize each pack for its full potential lowers tonnage of batteries being discarded each year. Diagnostic Battery Management also improves system reliability and lowers operational costs.\nWe marvel about technological advancements but are less impressed with battery diagnostics. The battery still behaves like a “black box” with a mind of its own. In the near future, battery diagnostics will be built into chargers, analyzers and monitoring devices in the form of software running in the background and providing quality control in batteries. These advancements can be made economically and with minimal price premium. Industries benefitting from these developments are public safety, healthcare, defense, automotive, logistics, transportation and mining.\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/shipping-lithium-based-batteries-by-air",
        "content": "Regulations made easy to Understand\nBattery shipment has come under strict transportation regulation and this is especially critical with lithium-based products. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Dangerous Goods Regulation (DGR) are trusted resources to help prepare and document dangerous shipments. Recognized by the world’s airlines for over 50 years, the DGR Manual is the global reference for shipping dangerous goods by air. (See http://www.iata.org/publications/dgr/Pages/index.aspx)\nLi-ion batteries have improved and the official failure rate has been reduced to one-in-10 million. Experts believe that this number is high as unplanned events are few and far in between. Examining 113 recorded incidents of transporting batteries by air in 19 years reveals that most failures occurred due to inappropriate packaging or handling. This resulted in battery damage that triggered an electrical short. Most events happened at airports or in cargo hubs and not on a carrier. Lead, nickel and alkaline-based systems are part of the problem, not just lithium-ion as is commonly perceived.\nIATA published Dangerous Goods Regulations that provides guidelines in the shipment of lithium-based batteries on passenger and cargo aircraft. The quantity permitted is based on watt-hours (Wh). Wh establishes the lithium content by multiplying voltage with the ampere-hours (Ah). For example, multiplying 14.40V by 5Ah battery comes to 72Wh, a size that is common for a laptop battery. The article also informs what a traveler can take as carry-on on an aircraft. Since January 2008, lithium-based batteries can no longer be checked in with the baggage but airlines allow them as carry-on. The passenger compartment has better safety monitoring and access to fire extinguishers, should an event occur. Non-removable batteries do not count as batteries. Out of sight, out of mind.To protect against short circuit, IATA recommends placing battery packs into clear plastic bags. A battery pack must further be approved even if the cells in the pack had been approved. This provision also applies to modified battery packs.The transport of lithium-based battery products is divided into non-Class 9 hazardous material and Class 9 hazardous material. Non-Class 9 allows the shipment of small batteries in limited quantities and Class 9 hazardous material involving the shipment of larger battery sizes and in higher volume.The Packaging Instructions (PI) are organized into PI 965 to PI 970. PI 965 covers Li-ion cells and battery packs only, PI 966 includes Li-ion installed in equipment and PI 967 combines Li-ion with equipment. Lithium-metal batteries are categorized separately in PI 968 to 970.\nPackaging Instruction 965 — includes loose Li-ion cells and battery packs (UN 3480)Table 1 divides the transport of Li-ion products into four groups: Carry-on states the quantity of Li-ion cells and battery packs a passenger can take on an aircraft; Section 11 specifies shipment of small Li-ion products in low numbers; Section 1B advises on the shipment of small Li-ion products in larger numbers, and Section 1A governs larger Li-ion products. Only Carry-on and Section 11 are exempt from Class 9 hazardous material designation.IATA mandates that cells and battery packs cannot be combined in the same shipping box and recommends separate boxes. If the boxes can be combined into one shipping box, the Overpack label must be attached (please see below).\nTable 1: Packaging Instruction 965 covering Sections 11, 1B and 1A — Shipment of loose Li-ion cells and battery packs.\n1 Typical smartphone or tablet battery; 2 Typical laptop batteryNon-Class 9 shipments relating to PI 965 mandate additional guidelines.\nFigures 2: Caution label must be placed on all boxes containing lithium-based batteries\nClass 9 has these added regulations to the above mentioned requirements.\nLabel dimension: 100mm x 100mm (3.94″ x 3.94″)\nFigure 4: Class 9 Hazardous Material Label.\nPackaging Instruction 966 — governs Li-ion cells and battery packs with equipment (UN 3481) and Packaging Instruction 967 — governs Li-ion cells and battery packs in equipment (UN3481)These regulations are similar to PI 965 with the exceptions that Li-ion cells and battery packs can be shipped with, or in, the equipment. Equipment means an apparatus requiring Li-ion products to operate.\nTable 5: Packaging Instruction 966 and 967 — Shipment of Li-ion batteries with, and in equipment.PI 966 and PI 967 have these additional requirements.\nPackaging Instruction 968 — permits lithium-metal cells and battery packs (UN3090)Lithium-metal batteries have tighter shipping requirements than lithium ion batteries. Most Li-metal cells or battery packs are non-rechargeable found in watches, medical instruments, pacemakers, sensors, memory retention and more.\n2 battery packs\nTable 6: Packaging Instruction 968 — Shipment of lithium metal cells and battery packs.Effective 1 January 2015, lithium metal batteries will be restricted to cargo aircraft only. This only applies when shipping lithium metal batteries by themselves. Batteries packed with or contained in equipment can continue to be shipped on passenger aircraft.Additional Requirements for lithium metal batteries as part of PI 968:\nFigure 7: Cargo Aircraft Only label; added to one shipping box with other mandated labelsPackaging Instruction 969 — includes lithium metal with equipment (UN 3091)Packaging Instruction 970 — includes lithium metal in equipment (UN 3091)\nTable 8: Packaging Instruction 966 and 967 — Shipment of lithium metal batteries with and in equipment.The Internet provides excellent resources to assist in the shipment of dangerous goods. Simply google: “Shipping Li-ion batteries by air” and much help is offered. Also google “IATA training.”\nDefinition International Air Transport Association is a private organization that promotes cooperation among the world's scheduled airlines to ensure safe, secure, reliable, and economical air services. IATA harmonizes with other agencies internationally.\nAbout the AuthorIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

Exposure to high humidity and hot temperature can shorten service life.\nFigure 2: Swelling pouch cellSwelling can occur as part of gas generation. Battery manufacturers are at odds why this occasionally happens.\nTo prevent swelling, the manufacturer adds excess film to create a “gas bag” outside the cell. During the first charge, gases escape into the gasbag, which is then cut off and the pack is resealed as part of the finishing process. Gas buildup on subsequent charges is minimal; nevertheless, when designing the battery compartment for pouch cells, provision must be made to allow for some expansion. It is best not to stack pouch cells but to lay them flat side by side. The battery compartment must be made to protect the cell from mechanical stress and be free of sharp edges.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-801-setting-battery-performance-standards",
        "content": "A battery is a corrosive device that begins to fade the moment it comes off the assembly line. The stubborn behavior of batteries has left many users in awkward situations. The British Army could have lost the Falklands War in 1982 on account of uncooperative batteries. The officers assumed that a battery would always follow the rigid dictate of the military. Not so. When order was given to launch the missiles, nothing happened and no missiles flew that day. Battery-induced failures are common; some are a nuisance but others have serious consequences.\nEven with the best of care, a battery only lives for a defined number of cycles and time. It shares similarity with a living organism that develops an illness and dies early. Although the manufacturer may specify a given number of discharge/charge cycles, a battery has no distinct life span; the health rests much on environmental conditions and usage patterns.\nLead acid reaches the end of life when the active material has been consumed on the positive grids; nickel-based batteries lose performance because of corrosion. Lithium-ion fades over time when the transfer of ions slows down due to the buildup of layers on the electrodes (See BU-808b: What causes Li-ion to die?). Only the supercapacitor should achieve an unlimited number of cycles, but this is not a real battery.\nBattery manufacturers are aware of performance loss over time, and there is a deliberate silence on battery aging caused by capacity fade. Runtimes are always estimated with a perfect battery delivering 100 percent capacity. This is a momentary condition that only applies when the battery is new. While a dropped call because of a dying mobile phone battery only causes mild inconvenience, a power loss in a medical or military device can be devastating.\nConsumers have learned to take advertised battery runtimes in their stride. Performance data means little and no other specification is as loosely given as that of the battery, especially in consumer products. The manufacturer knows this and gets away with it, in part due to the difficulty of verification. Very seldom does a user challenge the battery manufacturer for failing to deliver the specified battery performance, even when human lives are at stake. Less critical failures have been challenged in court and dealt with in a harsh way.\nThe battery is an elusive scapegoat that evades inspections; it’s as if it holds special immunity and privileges. Should the battery quit during a critical mission, then this is seen as beyond control; some may call it an act of God, as if it were triggered by a natural cause that could not have been prevented.\nBatteries should receive the same treatment as a critical part in an aircraft, medical device or industrial machine where the wear and tear falls under strict maintenance guidelines. Authorities struggle to implement such guidelines and for good reasons. Generally accepted test procedures have not yet been established for batteries, and even auditors doing quality control shy away from such ruling and only examine the outer appearance; state-of-health is mostly ignored. This allows faded batteries to hide comfortably among their stronger peers. The omission is in part connected with a lack of battery test devices that can reliably assess a battery on the fly.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Private transportation is a much desired and emotional issue and governments are promoting this culture by subsidizing roads and even handing out grants to buy certain vehicles. Already in the 1950s, the car was given the status of supreme ruler and commuter trains were removed in favor of freeways. With pollution hitting the tipping point and roads in gridlock, the lack of long-term city planning is becoming evident. Commuting by car in an urban setting is not sustainable as the road system cannot accommodate the population growth in urban areas.\nIn the 1930s, Europe had a different vision for the car. With a large rural population, farmers needed low-cost transportation and Citroën, a French carmaker, designed a “rugged umbrella on four wheels.” The car was to carry four workers and a payload of 100kg (220 lb), traveling at a top speed of 60km/h (37mph) on a well-suspended chassis that did not break farm eggs when driving across a ploughed field. The vehicle was to consume no more than 3 liters of gasoline per 100km (78mpg). The first models had a 375cc motor developing 9hp; the 2CV (my first car in Switzerland) had the larger 425cc engine with 12hp (9kW). With a tailwind the car would reach a top speed of 85km/h (53mph). Figure 1 illustrates a 1958 Citroen 2CV.\nIn 1930, the main objectives were economical transportation for people and goods and the Citroen 2CV met this criterion with a 425cc air-cooled two-cylinder motor producing 12hp.\nIn 1934, then chancellor Adolf Hitler gave Ferdinand Porsche specifications to build the Volkswagen: a “people’s car” capable of transporting two adults and three children at 100 km/h (62 mph) while consuming no more than 7 liters of fuel per 100 km. The engine had to be powerful enough to maintain cruising speeds on Germany’s new freeways, which Hitler is said to have promoted to ease mass unemployment. Hitler asked for a simple design to make the car affordable and to ensure that worn parts could be exchanged quickly and cheaply. The car was to be made available to citizens on a savings scheme at a price that was less than a worker’s 2-year income.\nToday’s luxury cars are powered with 275hp (200kW) engines, enough to provide electrical energy for 10 houses. Most vehicles carry only the driver, and few restrictions exist as to vehicle size, horsepower and distances driven. Our highways are mostly free to use; general tax revenue and gas tax pay for them. A research group said that gasoline would need to cost five-times the current price if drivers were to pay for the highway costs.\nFree-roaming takes a toll on the environment. According to the US Department of Energy, 71 percent of the oil consumed in the USA is for transportation and 51 percent goes to passenger cars and light trucks.\nConcerns about pollution by burning fossil fuel were first published in 1971; governments acknowledged an environmental demise in 1991, and today our leaders are taking note but cannot halt the rise of greenhouse gases. Over the past 400,000 years, CO2 concentrations have fluctuated between 180 and 280 parts per million; today’s level is at 410 parts per million.\nThe US burns 20 million barrels of oil a day (20,466 in 2019; 1 US barrel has 159 liters). Europe, with twice the population and a comparable standard of living, consumes only half this amount. More could be done to reduce consumption, and concerned citizens feel that climate change is not being taken seriously in the West. An analogy is vodka consumption in Russia that causes drunkenness. Stopping the flow, economists say, would bring the country to a halt.\nScientists say that developed nations consume a level of energy that is one-and-a-half times what mother earth can produce. Folks living in the next millennium might fret over the environmental damage their forefathers have caused, forcing millions of farmers in water-starved territories to flee the once fruitful land because of encroaching deserts. Schoolbooks may describe how wealthy businessmen lined their pockets while politicians looked the other way and denied any connection with human activity and unusual weather patterns. Questions will be asked why past leaders did nothing to slow a frivolous and unsustainable lifestyle.\nNo one likes change, and when the medical associations realized in the 1970s that smoking tobacco was harmful to human health, the then US president Ronald Reagan hinted, “Yes, we must do everything to cut down on smoking, but let’s not hurt the tobacco industry” (paraphrased).\nNew European cars under the 2015 law can only emit 130 grams of CO2 per kilometer. This is equal to 5.6 l/km (42mpg). The 2021 target will be 95g/km and 4.1 l/km (57mpg). Car makers must pay 95 euro per gram of excess emission premiums for each vehicle that exceeds this limit. Japan is following the lead and also requires and achieves emission levels of about 130g/km.\nThe US president said that America is getting tough on car pollution as well. Progress was made and the CO2 release of 268g/kg in 2010 was lowered to an average of 190g/km, or 8.15 l/100km (29mpg), on 2015 model cars. Much work still lies ahead to reduce fuel consumption as burning 1 liter of gasoline generates 2.3kg of CO2 (19 lb per US gallon).\nResource-rich Americans dislike limitations while resource-lean countries in Europe and Asia were enticed to conserve and get innovative. Our European and Japanese friends have demonstrated that protecting our environment is possible without sacrificing standard of living. Much work will revolve around the electric powertrain, but no battery exists yet that can match hydrocarbons in net calorific value. Limitations will continue as long as the battery operates on an electrochemical process.\nThe goal for humanity is to maintain an environment that is sustainable, finds contentment and provides social justice. Rich nations may not reach this objective without the help from poorer lands, These caring and resourceful folks may one day come forth to teach the well-established that material possession does not satisfy and that the deeper meaning of life is love, relationships and spiritual fulfillment. They will tell rich nations to go back to the basics and rediscover the bounty of this fine earth by letting go of excess baggage. Those who find the virtue of simplicity will finally begin to enjoy life more abundantly.\n[1] Courtesy Classic Car Catalogue\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-503-determining-power-deliver-by-the-ragone-plot",
        "content": "Nature offers many means to produce power. Most are through combustion, mechanical movement, photosynthesis or electrochemical reaction as in a battery. An electrochemical reaction produces a voltage potential, and multiplying the voltage by the current that flows when closing the electrical circuit provides power. Power is measured in watts in honor of James Watt, the eighteenth-century developer of the steam engine.\nThe most simplistic manifestation of a battery is a lemon. Driving a zinc-plated nail and a copper coin into a lemon creates a voltage. This quasi battery does not deliver much power; its current delivery system is very poor and any electrical load causes the voltage to collapse.\nAll power sources have limitations and the energy drawn must be harnessed carefully so as not to exceed the permitted loading. An analogy is a bicycle rider who chooses the best gear ratio to transfer energy into propulsion. On a flat road a high gear provides fast movement with moderate pedal action, and this can be compared to high voltage. Climbing a hill with the same pedaling action increases the torque, and in our analogy this corresponds to high current. The pedal force the rider exerts relates to power in watt (W); the endurance before exhaustion defines energy in watt/hours (Wh).\nA battery is rated in ampere/hours (Ah); it specifies how much current a pack can deliver in an hour. Like fluid in a container, the energy can be dispensed slowly over a long period of time or rapidly in a short time. The amount of liquid a container holds is analogous to the energy in a battery; how quickly the liquid is dispensed is analogous to power.\nAn alkaline battery has low power with a relatively high specific energy (capacity). See BU-106: Primary Batteries This lends itself well for a flashlight or a similar light load. In comparison, most rechargeable batteries have high load capabilities to drive power tools and crank internal combustion engines but these batteries have lower capacities than the primary counterpart.\nThe relationship between energy and power can best be represented in a Ragone plot. Named after David V. Ragone, the Ragone plot places the energy in Wh on the horizontal x axis and power in W on the vertical y axis. The derived power curve provides a clear demarcation line of what level of power a battery can deliver. The Ragone plot is logarithmic, which enables displaying performance profiles of extremely high and low power. Some table may reverse the W and Wh positioning.\nFigure 2 illustrates the Ragone plot reflecting the discharge energy and discharge power of four lithium-ion systems packaged in 18650 cells. The diagonal lines across the field disclose the length of time the battery cells can deliver energy at various loading conditions. The battery chemistries featured are the most common power-based lithium-ion systems, which include lithium-iron phosphate (LFP), lithium-manganese oxide (LMO), and nickel manganese cobalt (NMC)\nLegend: The A123 APR18650M1 is a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) with 1,100mAh and a continuous discharge current of 30A. The Sony US18650VT and Sanyo UR18650W are manganese–based Li-ion cells of 1500mAh each with a continuous discharge current of 20A. The Sanyo UR18650F is a 2,600mAh cell for a moderate 5A.discharge. This cell provides the highest discharge energy but has the lowest discharge power.\nThe physical dimensions of a battery are specified by volume in liter (l) and weight in kilogram (kg). Adding dimension and weight enables rating a battery in specific energy in Wh/kg, power density in Wh/l and specific power in W/kg. Most batteries are rated in Wh/kg, revealing how much energy a given weight can generate. Wh/l denotes watt/hours per liter.\nThe Sanyo UR18650F has the highest specific energy and can power a laptop or e-bike for many hours at a moderate load. The Sanyo UR18650W, in comparison, has a lower specific energy but can supply a current of 20A. The A123 has the lowest specific energy but offers the highest power capability by delivering 30A of continuous current.\nThe Ragone plot helps choosing the best Li-ion system to satisfy maximum discharge power and optimal discharge energy as a function of discharge time. If an application calls for very high discharge current, the 3.3 minute diagonal line on the chart points to the A123 (Battery 1) as a good pick; it can deliver up to 40 Watts of power for 3.3 minutes. The Sanyo F (Battery 4) is slightly lower and delivers about 36 Watts. Focusing on discharge time and following the 33 minute discharge line further down, Battery 1 (A123) only delivers 5.8 Watts for 33 minutes before the energy is depleted whereas the higher capacity Battery 4 (Sanyo F) can provide roughly 17 Watts for the same time; its limitation is lower power.\nBattery manufacturers take the Ragone snapshot on new cells, a condition that is only valid for a short time. When calculating power and energy thresholds, design engineers must consider battery fade caused by cycling and aging. Design battery operated systems that still provide full function with a battery that has faded to 70 or 80 percent. A further consideration is temperature as batteries lose power when cold. The Ragone plot does not show these discrepancies and the design engineer must take these less-than-ideal-conditions into consideration by studying the manufacturer’s specifications.\nIt should be noted that loading a battery to its full power handling increases stress and shortens the life. When a high current draw is needed continuously, the battery pack should be made larger. Tesla does this with their Model S cars by doubling and tripling the battery size compared to other EVs; BMW i3 uses a smaller but more rugged Li-ion system. An analogy can be drawn with a heavy truck that is fitted with a large diesel engine to provide long and durable service as opposed to installing a souped-up sports car engine with similar horsepower.\nThe Ragone plot is also suitable to calculate power requirements of other energy sources and storage devices, such as capacitors, flywheels, flow batteries and fuel cells. Fuel cells and internal combustion engines drawing fuel from a tank causes a conflict in that energy-delivery can be made continuous. This distorts the Wh measurements of a self-contained battery (or the bicycle rider) to determine the available intrinsic energy before recharging is required.\nSimilar plots are also deployed to establish the optimal energy/power ratio and loading condition of renewable power sources such as solar cells and wind turbines. An example of such a chart is the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) used on charge controllers to charge batteries from renewable resources. See BU-413: Charging with Solar, Turbine MPPT allows optimal power transfer without overloading the source when the supply is low during fringe conditions Also see Figure 2 in specific energy and specific power of rechargeable batteries table.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/industrial-applications",
        "content": "Industrial applications have unique power needs and the choice of battery is important. While consumer products demand high energy density to obtain slim and elegant designs, industry focuses on durability and reliability. Industrial batteries are commonly bulkier than those used in consumer products but achieve a longer service life. Batteries are electro-chemical devices that convert higher-level active materials into an alternate state during discharge. The speed of such transaction determines the load characteristics of a battery. Also referred to as concentration polarization, the nickel and lithium-based batteries are superior to lead-based batteries in reaction speed. This attribute reflects in good load characteristics.Discharge loads range from a low and steady current flow of a flashlight to intermittent high current bursts in a power tool, to sharp current pulses on digital communications equipment, laptops and cameras. In this paper we evaluate how the various battery chemistries perform in a given application.\nNickel-cadmium batteries continue to power a large percentage of professional cameras. This battery provided reliable service and performs well at low temperature. nickel-cadmium is one of the most enduring batteries in terms of service life but has only moderate energy density and needs a periodic full discharge. The need for longer runtimes is causing a switch to nickel-metal-hydride. This battery offers up to 50% more energy than nickel-cadmium. However, the high current spikes drawn by digital cameras have a negative affect and the nickel-metal-hydride battery suffers from short service life. There is a trend towards lithium-ion. Among rechargeables, this chemistry has the highest energy density and is lightweight. A steep price tag and the inability to provide high currents are negatives. The 18650 cylindrical lithium-ion cell offers the most economical power source. \"18\" defines the cell's diameter in millimeters and \"650\" the length. No other lithium-ion cell, including prismatic or polymer types, offers a similar low cost-per-watt ratio. Over the years, several cell versions of 18650 cells with different Ah ratings have emerged, ranging from 1.8Ah to well above 2Ah. The cells with moderate capacities offer better temperature performance, enable higher currents and provide a longer service life than the souped up versions. The typical 18650 for industrial use is rated at 2Ah at 3.60 volts. Four cells are connected in series to obtain the roughly 15 volts needed for the cameras. Paralleling the cells increases the current handling by about 2A per cell. Three cells in parallel would provide about 6A of continuous power. Four cells in series and three in parallel is a practical limit for the 18650 system.Lithium-ion requires a protection circuit to provide safe operations under all circumstances. Each cell in series is protected against voltage peaks and dips. In addition, the protection circuit limits each cell to a current about 2A. Even if paralleled, the current of a lithium-ion pack is not high enough to drive digital cameras requiring 10 to 15A peak current. Tests conducted at Cadex Electronics have shown that the 18650 allows short current peaks above the 2A/cell limit. This would allow the use of lithium-ion on digital cameras, provided the current bursts are limited to only a few seconds.\nThe power requirement of a professional digital camera is sporadic in nature. Much battery power is needed to take snapshots, some with a powerful flash. To view the photo, the backlit color display draws additional power. Transmitting a high-resolution image over the air depletes another portion of the energy reserve.Most non-professional cameras use a primary lithium battery. This battery type provides the highest energy density but cannot be recharged. This is a major drawback for professional use. Rechargeable batteries are the answer and lithium-ion fits the bill but faces similar challenges to the video cameras.\nOne of the most energy-hungry portable medical devices is the heart defibrillator. The battery draws in excess of 10 amperes during preparation stages. Several shocks may be needed to get the patient's heart going again. The battery must not hamper the best possible patient care.Most defibrillators are powered by nickel-cadmium. nickel-metal-hydride is also being used but there is concern of short service life. In a recent study, however, it was observed that a defibrillator battery cycles far less than expected. Instead of the anticipated 200 cycles after two years of seemingly heavy use, less than 60 cycles had been delivered on the battery examined. 'Smart' battery technology makes such information possible. With fewer cycles needed, the switch to higher energy-dense batteries becomes a practical alternative.Sealed lead-acid batteries are often used to power defibrillators intended for standby mode. Although bulky and heavy, the Lead-acid has a low self-discharge and can be kept in prolonged ready mode without the need to recharge. Lead-acid performs well on high current spurts. During the rest periods the battery disperses the depleted acid concentrations back into the electrode plate. Lead-acid would not be suitable for a sustained high load. The medical industry is moving towards lithium-ion. The robust and economical 18650 cells make this possible. The short but high current spurts needed for defibrillators are still a challenge. Paralleling the cells and adding current-limiting circuits that allow short spikes of high current will help overcome this hurdle.\nPower tools require up to 50 amperes of current and operate in an unfriendly environment. The tool must perform at sub zero temperatures and endure in high heat. The batteries must also withstand shock and vibration. Most power tools are equipped with nickel-cadmium batteries. nickel-metal-hydride has been tried with limited success. Longevity is a problem but new designs have improved. lithium-ion is too delicate and could not provide the high amperage. Lead-acid is too bulky and lacks persistent power delivery. The power tool has simply no suitable alternatives to the rugged and hard-working nickel-cadmium. In an attempt to pack more energy into power tools, the battery voltage is increased. Because of heavy current and application at low temperatures, cell matching is important. Cell matching becomes more critical as the number of cell connected in series increases. A weak cell holds less capacity and is discharged more quickly than the strong ones. This imbalance causes cell reversal on the weak cell if the battery is discharged at high current below 1V/cell. An electrical short occurs in the weak cell if exposed to reverse current and the pack needs to be replaced. The higher the battery voltage, the more likely will a weak cell get damaged.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "How to Service Cell Phone Batteries",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/how-to-service-cell-phone-batteries",
        "content": "With the move to lithium-ion, fewer cell phone batteries fail during the warranty period than with nickel-based chemistries. Lithium-ion is less temperamental and needs less customer preparation than nickel. Yet, the volume of returned batteries remains relatively high. A North American cellular provider with about 12 million subscribers receives roughly 70,000 warranty returns per month. Out of these returned handsets, 50% have mechanical failures; 30% are performance related issues; 15% have battery or charger related problems; and 5% have miscellaneous faults.\nThere are many reasons for the battery failures. The battery may not have been properly charged before use. Perhaps the packs remained on the shelf too long or the charger is not functioning correctly. Lack of battery understanding may also be to blame. The true reason may never be known. To satisfy the customer and honor warranty obligations, the stores provide a replacement battery, no questions asked. Competition makes it tough to do otherwise. The faulty batteries are then returned to the manufacturer for replacement. Phone manufacturers are aware that 80-90% of the returned batteries have either no problem or can easily be restored with a battery analyzer. The remaining 10-20% can often be revived by reactivating the safety circuit with a boot program and by applying charge/discharge cycles. Only a small percentage of batteries returned under warranty exhibit non-correctable faults. Not all batteries and handsets brought in for service fail due to manufacturer's defects. Some batteries get damaged due to dropping and other physical abuse. A Service Manager of a leading cell-phone manufacturer hinted that coffee submersion is a common cause of failure. The acid in the coffee manages to corrode the electrical conductors in the handset and the battery. Coffee submersion occurs when the user accidentally mistakes the cup of coffee with the charger or cradle.To reduce the flow of warranty goods, some manufacturers began charging $35US for no-fault returns. With the added cost, the dealers had no other option than to continue accepting and replacing returns from fickle customers. Warehouses started to fill with dead merchandise; and in 1997 a critical mass was reached. The cost of exchange, lost time by retail staff, shipping, warehousing and paying a subsidy for a replacement phone became a multi-million dollar problem.\nIn an effort to salvage returned batteries, some mobile phone manufacturers segregate battery packs according to purchase date. Packs returned within the thirty-day warranty period are marked type 'B'. The batteries are then consolidated and sent to a regional service center where they are serviced. Batteries that are clean, (have no coffee residue) and regain a capacity of 80% or higher, are relabeled and sold at a discount price. The refurbishing program reclaims over 90% of the returned batteries. On the strength of the success, some battery-refurbishing houses have extended the service to include batteries that are up to one year old. Repairing these older packs yields a 40-70% restoration rate. Managers have indicated that effectively run battery refurbishing centers manage to generate a profit. Equally importantly is the environmental benefit in restoring rather than disposing of a battery.\nServicing a batteries at point-of-sale is becoming a viable alternative to sending the pack to central service centers. With storefront service, the pack goes no further than to the store that sold the product. The batteries are tested, repackaged, and made ready for the next customer with a battery problem. This eliminates courier charges and relieves the warranty obligation by the manufacturers.\nModern battery analyzers are equipped with rapid-test programs that assess the battery state-of-health in a few minutes. Some analyzers (Cadex) offer a boost program to wake up seemingly dead batteries because regular chargers can no longer recharge these packs. The service takes only a few minutes. How does a battery fall asleep? A lithium-ion may become dysfunctional if discharged too deeply without applying a recharge after use. The boost program applies a gentle charge current to reactivate the battery's safety circuit. A fast-charge follows. To demonstrate the effectiveness of boost, 27 of 92 returned lithium-ion batteries were permanently restored with the boost function of a battery analyzer (Cadex C7400) at the Cadex test laboratory.If a pack requires a complete service of priming and reconditioning, the customer is asked to come back later. Alternatively, a refurbished battery can be given as a replacement. Only batteries with mechanical defects or those with non-correctable electrical problems need replacement. Connecting the battery to the analyzer has been a major challenge for customer service staff. Setting the correct battery parameters and selecting a program is another hurdle. If a store handles a limited number of phones or if trained staff is not available, custom battery adapters are the answer. Custom adapters are made for a specific battery type and allow easy insertion of the battery. A wrong connection is not possible. Because of the firm contact provided between battery and analyzer, the custom adapters produce the most accurate readings, especially on rapid-testing. (Cadex offers the SnapLock custom adapters that automatically configure the analyzer to the correct setting.) Service technicians dealing with a multitude of batteries may prefer a universal battery adapter. This requires programming the battery analyzer to the correct battery chemistry, voltage and milliampere rating. Once set, these parameters can be stored in those adapters equipped with a memory chip. (The Cadex adapters hold up to 10 battery configuration codes. If more storage is needed, a PC with BatteryShop™ software will be required. With a PC, the user can program the analyzer by clicking the mouse on the selected battery.)\nPoint-of-sale service has only become feasible with modern, easy-to-use battery analyzers. Older units were designed for trained technicians and engineers. The programs consisted of cycling to remove the 'memory' on nickel-based batteries. Lithium-ion no longer suffers from memory and cycling has little effect in improving this battery chemistry. Today, customers want fast service and are not prepared to wait for long service procedures. Neither can the equipment be tied up for any length of time. One of the key features of the modern battery analyzer is the ability to assess the battery quickly and apply the needed repairs in minutes rather than hours.Offering battery test service at storefronts improves customer service and enhances overall customer satisfaction. Organizations using modern battery analyzers have reported sharp reductions in service related expenses. Manufacturers support storefront service and often furnish the participating dealers with battery analyzers of choice. This trend is growing. With camera phones and increasing use of data transmissions, the battery is becoming a critical part in the overall performance of a cell phone.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/perception-of-a-battery-tester",
        "content": "Battery testers are readily available but we ask: “How well do they work?” Not everybody is familiar with the test results given, other than knowing that voltage relates to state-of-charge (SoC) and internal resistance (Ri) to power and loading conditions. Capacity readings are outside the capability of most battery testers. Capacity is the leading health indicator that governs end-of-life when the battery has faded. Loss of energy storage goes mostly unnoticed while the readings on a battery tester remain unchanged. This leaves service personnel unable to decide if a battery needs replacement or not.\nBattery performance and symptoms also change with temperature and SoC level. A good battery with a partial charge performs similar to a fully charged battery that is weak. A battery tester should identify these conditions, but most cannot do this.\nA battery is like a “black box.” The pack looks similar if fully charged or empty, new or faded. In comparison, a car tire distorts when low on air and is replaced when the treads are worn. In spite of this disguise, the battery reveals characteristics that instruments can measure to various levels of accuracy.\nSoC is checked by voltage, but inaccuracies occur if the battery has been agitated. Voltage readings after a charge stay high for a time and a discharge depresses the voltage. Normalizing takes a few hours. Most battery testers measure Ri by applying\na calibrated discharge pulse and observe the voltage drop. Ohm’s Law (V=I x R) provides the Ri by dividing the voltage drop with the applied current.\nThe Ri of a battery does not correlate well with capacity. Tests at Cadex labs reveal a correlation between capacity and Ri of only 51%. Ri alone does not provide the full picture. Some battery testers also analyze voltage recovery that relates to state\n-of-health (SoH). A good battery recovers quicker than a faded one. These described phenomena apply similarly to lead acid and lithium-based chemistries.\nFigure 2 demonstrates the causes of failure for lead acid starter batteries. At 48%, capacity fade is the most common failure mode induced by wearing out of the active material. In comparison, the rise of Ri only accounts for 12%. The test-pool also includes batteries that are over discharged (23%) and have no fault (15%). Mechanical and manufacturing defects are at a low 2%.\nBetter test methods will keep batteries in service longer, as packs are often returned with no specific defect. Customer-induced failures, such as low charge, could be eliminated.\nBattery manufacturers are seeking advanced battery-test methods to improve fabrication and identify user-induced failures. Industries also seek solutions as part of Reliability-centered Maintenance (RCM). Defined by the SAE standard JA1011, RCM is a maintenance protocol that ensures continued reliability on mechanical parts by observing wear-and-tear. Introduced in the 1960s, airlines were first to adopt the standard to reduce invasive maintenance. The military accepted the system in 1967, which led to civil users in nuclear power plants, oil & gas, subways and hospitals.\nCurrently, RCM does not include batteries. Part of the omission may be lack of suitable test methods. A Battery Management System (BMS) could be used, but monitoring voltage, current and temperature only detects anomalies. The Remaining Useful Life (RUL) representing capacity is not available. Nor does a data stamp provide a reliable indication as to when a battery should be replaced. Batteries are often swapped too soon; however most stay in service too long.\nChecking batteries beyond measuring voltage and Ri gets complex. A battery resembles a living organism that consists of components which consume active materials, build-up performance-inhibiting films robbing power and undergo mechanical stress leading to elevated self-discharge. Battery longevity can be defined by these characteristics:\nUndetected aging effects may cause thermal runaway, which is a concern especially for Li-ion batteries. Installing RCM for a critical battery system asks these questions:\nAdvancements are being made by characterizing various properties of a battery using a technique such as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). EIS injects sinusoidal signals of multiple frequencies into the battery and measures the impedance response in the form of a Nyquist plot. Cadex has secured a proprietary technology to translate the Nyquist plot into battery SoH and SoC. Here is how it works.\nThe Nyquist plot is fitted with battery models reflecting diverse battery internal properties. The reference images of the model parameters of good and poor batteries had been made available by scanning a large pool of batteries with similar architecture but diverse states of performance. The model parameters are then passed through an advanced data analytics algorithm such as fuzzy logic to determine capacity, Ri and So. Figure 3 illustrates the concept of multi-model EIS technology in a simplified way. Multi-model EIS is also known as Spectro™.\nBattery testers using EIS technology developed by Cadex are deployed in the auto industry to check starter batteries. Capacity measurement is preferred because Cold Cranking Amp (CCA) alone does not provide RUL information. CCA readings on most starter batteries stay normal while the capacity fades without knowing. This often leads to unexpected failures as strong engine cranking does not reflect low capacity.\nThe Spectro™ technology can also be used to test model-specific batteries in lead acid and lithium chemistries. Each battery model is first scanned to create a “golden sample” representing a known good battery. Aging symptoms are analyzed by observing subtle changes of the Nyquist plot against the mirror image of a battery in new condition.\nCloud connectivity simplifies the logistics by downloading model-specific golden samples along with various aged battery data. Spectro™ devices in the form of hand-held testers (Cadex) and BMS installations provide the test results, organized by date and model number, and stored in the Cadex Cloud. Big data improves accuracy, processed by machine learning and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), technologies that Spectro™ provides.\nFigure 4 illustrates ANN that analyzes a vast volume of data and provides a classified output with the help of hidden layers. The connecting units called neurons form a biological brain that simulates animal instinct. One might argue: “Garbage in; garbage out,” but volume of user patterns can produce amazing results with ANN.\nThe Cadex lab is testing the accuracies of ANN and machine learning algorithms such as Gaussian Process Regression to determine battery SoH. The Gaussian method is more effective on our lead acid battery dataset (~90% accurate) and gets superior results with fewer data than with ANN. These findings are verified by research scientists at UBC. Cadex is exploring these discoveries further with lead acid, NiMH and Li ion batteries.\nTypical applications for the Advanced Battery Analytic System (ABAS) are fleet supervision by tracking battery performance in the field with EIS-based testers and EIS-backed BMS installations. With ABAS, the supervisor sets the Target Selector to calculated capacity thresholds for each battery system with the intent to keep the batteries in service as long as possible while maintaining confidence in the system. Such a system utilizes each battery fully while improving reliability and lowering the environmental impact of discarding batteries too early.\nThe more sophisticated a test method becomes, the further technology begins to decipher symptoms. \nAn example is weather forecast that observes changes in temperature, wind speed and moisture. Face recognition is another example by comparing anchor points. Letter and voice recognition are further applications in which machine learning recognizes subtle nuances to find a collective meaning.\nWith more advanced estimation tools, no singular reading delivers a finite result. Machine learning improves accuracy without giving explicit instructions. A subset of artificial intelligence, machine learning uses algorithms and statistical models to analyze data and draw inferences from data patterns. Scientists predict that the future of battery analysis lays in EIS with machine-learning and cloud connectivity. Vast data will serve as lookup tables to provide amazingly accurate battery evaluation for major battery models.\nKey to advanced battery analysis is reading the “chemical battery” rather than processing data with peripheral digital engines. Chemical-based battery analysis has not advanced as rapidly as digital technologies. EIS with machine learning, neural networking and cloud connectivity brings battery analysis to new levels. These relevant technologies will also improve fleet supervision for organizations.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-603-how-to-calibrate-a-smart-battery",
        "content": "When designing a fuel gauge, engineers commonly make a misjudgement by assuming that a battery will always stay young. As with people, batteries age and the changing characteristics must be taken into account to maintain accuracy. Fancy fuel gauges can provide a false sense of security in believing that the displayed battery readings are correct. For the casual user of a mobile phone or laptop, a fuel gauge error is only a mild irritant, but the problem escalates with medical and military devices, as well as drones and electric drivetrains that depend on precise range predictions.\nThe chemical battery representing the actual energy storage remains the master while the digital battery provides peripheral support by relying on the information obtained from charge and discharge cycles. But like all fine machines, precise settings begin to shift and need adjustment. The same happens with an SMBus battery that also require periodic calibration. The instructions for an Apple iPad reads: “For proper reporting of SoC, be sure to go through at least one full charge/discharge cycle per month.”\nFigure 1 demonstrates a digital battery that is drifting away from the chemical battery; calibration corrects the tracking error. The accumulating error is application related and the drift on the chart is accentuated for effect.\nNote: The accumulating error is application related; the values on the chart are accentuated.\nA smart battery self-calibrates by taking advantage of occasional full discharges, but in real life this seldom happens. Most discharges are intermittent and go to random depth. In addition, the load signatures often consist of high frequency pulses that are difficult to capture. The partially discharged battery may be partly recharged and then stored in a warm room, causing elevated self-discharge that cannot be tracked. These anomalies add to the display error that amplifies with use and time.\nTo maintain accuracy, a smart battery should periodically be calibrated by running the pack down in the device until “Low Battery” appears and then apply a recharge. The full discharge sets the discharge flag and the full charge establishes the charge flag. A linear line forms between these two anchor points that allow SoC estimation. In time, this line gets blurred again and the battery requires recalibration. Figure 2 illustrates the full-discharge and full-charge flags.\nCalibration occurs by applying a full charge, discharge and charge. This is done in the equipment or with a battery analyzer as part of battery maintenance.\nBattery analyzers serve as a valuable tool to calibrate a smart battery. An analyzer fully charges the battery and then applies a controlled discharge that provides the all-important capacity readings of the chemical battery. This discharge measurement is a truer reading than what coulomb counting provides by capturing past discharge events of the digital battery.\nHow often should a battery be calibrated? The answer depends on the application. For a battery that is in continued use, a calibration should be done once every 3 months or after 40 partial cycles. If the portable device applies a periodic full deep discharge on its own accord, then no additional calibration should be needed.\nWhat happens if the battery is not calibrated regularly? Can such a battery be used with confidence? Most smart battery chargers obey the dictates of the chemical battery rather than the digital battery and there are no safety concerns. The battery should function normally, but the digital readout may become unreliable.\nSome smart batteries feature impedance tracking. This is a self-learning algorithm that reduces or eliminates the need to calibrate. If calibration is required, however, several cycles instead of only one may be needed to achieve the same result as with a standard system.\nThe accuracy between the chemical and digital battery is measured by the Max Error. Max Error stands for “maximum error” and is presented in percentage. A low reading indicates good accuracy, and as the precision diminishes with partial cycles, the Max Error number increases steadily. This supervisory watchdog can be compared to a medical doctor who measures a medical condition by a number.\nSome manufacturers recommend calibration at a Max Error of 8 percent; readings above 12 percent may trigger an alarm and 16 could render the battery unserviceable. No unified standard exists to determine what Max Error level requires service or what constitutes an error; every battery manufacturer follows its own recommendation.\nThe SMBus system provides a wealth of information that includes battery manufacturing date, battery model and serial number, capacity, temperature and estimated runtime, as well as voltages down to the cell levels. It is an engineer’s delight to have all this data in a table, but the fine print may confuse the user more than providing help. A busy nurse in a hospital, the policeman on duty and the solider in combat has only one question: “Will the battery last for my mission?” Figure 3 illustrates a screenshot of the data stored in an SMBus battery.\nOf special interest in terms of battery state-of-health (SoH) is full charge capacity (FCC), coulomb count that is hidden in the table among tons of other information. FCC can be used with reasonable accuracy to estimate battery SoH without applying a full discharge cycle to measure capacity. Best accuracies are achieved if the battery is being cycled with a full charge and an occasional deep discharge. If used sporadically, a deliberate calibration involving a full discharge/charge cycle will be needed from time-to-time to maintain accuracy.\n[1] Courtesy Cadex[2] Source: Texas Instrument\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-905-testing-lead-acid-batteries",
        "content": "There are no shortages of battery testers, but most lack accuracy. Capacity, the leading health indicator of a battery, is difficult to obtain on the fly. Stating that a battery tester measuring internal resistance will also provide capacity estimation is misleading. Advertising features that are outside the equipment’s capabilities confuses the industry into believing that complex tests can be done with basic methods. Resistance-based instruments can identify a dying or dead battery — so does the user. Vendors often overstate the ability of battery testers knowingly. This is similar to promoting a shampoo that promises to grow lush hair on a man’s bald head.\nWithout reliable test devices on hand, battery testing becomes guesswork, resulting in good packs being replaced too soon and passing weak ones, only to have them fail on the road soon after checking. Lack of accurate battery testing also causes unnecessary replacements under the battery warranty program. Examining warranty returns reveals that less than 10 percent of these batteries have a manufacturing fault. Most faults are user-inflicted.\nThe challenge arises when assessing a battery as part of routine service before performance degradations are noticeable. Such a test is only effective when including capacity measurement. Capacity oversees the energy storage, governs the runtime and predicts the end-of-life. Internal resistance, on the other hand, is responsible for the power to crank the engine and deliver high current under load on demand. A snapshot taken with a CCA tester on a starter battery refers to the resistive battery condition only. Better electrolytes and corrosion-resistant electrode materials are keeping the resistance on modern batteries low through most of their life. Failure due to elevated resistance has become rare and may only develop at the end-of-life(See BU:901: Fundamentals of Battery Testing)\nUnlike voltage, current and ohmic measurements, no universal instrument exists that can read the capacity of every battery that comes along. There are three common testing concepts: Scalar, vector and EIS with complex modeling (Spectro™).\nScalar is the simplest of the three. It takes a battery reading and compares it with a reference that is often a resistive value. Most single-frequency AC conductance testers measuring CCA are based on the scalar concept.\nThe vector method applies signals of different currents or it excites the battery with varied frequencies, and then evaluates the results against preset vector points to study the battery under various stress conditions. This adds complexity and the added benefits are marginal.\nSpectro™ scans the battery with a frequency spectrum, as if to capture the topography of a landscape, and compares the imprint with a matrix to estimate battery capacity, CCA and SoC. Spectro™ promises the most in-depth battery analysis, but it is also the most complex(See also BU-904: How to Measure Capacity). Table 1 summarizes the three battery test methods.\nA matrix is a multi-dimensional look-up table against which readings are compared. Text recognition, fingerprint identification and visual imaging operate on a similar principle. In battery analysis, matrices are primarily used to estimate capacity; however, CCA and state-of-charge also benefit from using a matrix.\nSpectro™ correctly predicts 8 out of 10 batteries on capacity and 9 out of 10 on CCA. Combining these two classifications provides significant improvement in test accuracies over units measuring only CCA. Most resistance-based testers deliver state-of-health predictions that are not much better than 5 correct in 10, results that can be compared with tossing a coin. Many service technicians are unaware of the low prediction rate as lab verifications are seldom done.\nThere is a desire for higher accuracies, but a battery can only be diagnosed if measurable symptoms are present. While packs pulled from the field give the most reliable results, outliers often lack formatting or had been in prolonged storage. To also test these batteries with certainty, matrices can be developed that include the anomalies.\nState-of-charge also plays an important role, and the tester must distinguish between low charge and low capacity. Both conditions lower battery performance and are difficult to identify. Most battery testers work down to 70 percent SoC; Spectro™ goes down to 60 percent.\nCreating a matrix involves scanning many batteries at different state-of-health levels. The more batteries included in the mix that are the same model but have different capacity losses, the stronger the matrix will become. A well-developed matrix should include naturally-aged battery samples with capacities ranging from 50 to 100 percent. An analogy is a bridge with many pillars to eliminate weak spots.\nThe population should also include batteries from hot and cold climates and different uses. For example, an aging starter battery in a Las Vegas taxi will show different symptoms than the battery in grandma’s car in northern Germany used only to take her grandchildren for a ride.Obtaining faded batteries is difficult. Forced aging by cycling in an environmental chamber is of some help, but age-related stresses are not presented accurately and the learned symptoms can fool the system. This is especially visible with Li-ion batteries. Although the capacity is down, the Nyquist plot does not follow the signature of natural aging as part of daily usage(See BU-907: Testing Lithium-based Batteries)\nA generic matrix is most practical as it serves a group of batteries. Generic matrices for the Spectro™ system are available for most car batteries; the user simply enters the capacity and CCA ratings. Instead of a numeric readout, the generic matrix provides pass/fail classification based on a capacity threshold. This solution is acceptable for most service personnel as the instrument makes the decision, eliminating uncertainties and customer interference.\nA battery must undergo multiple checks, the way a medical doctor examines a patient with several tests to find the diagnosis. A serious illness could escape the doctor’s watchful eyes if only blood pressure or temperature were taken. While medical staff is well trained to evaluate the data points taken, most battery personnel do not have the same knowledge and only want to know if the battery is dead or alive. Nor are battery test devices capable of providing a detailed diagnosis of all battery ills. The battery user must be reminded that a battery tester is not a universal test tool but an estimation device that works for a designated battery population.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Can the Lead-acid Battery Compete in Modern Times?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/can-the-lead-acid-battery-compete-in-modern-times",
        "content": "The answer is YES. Lead-acid is the oldest rechargeable battery in existence. Invented by the French physician Gaston Planté in 1859, lead-acid was the first rechargeable battery for commercial use. 150 years later, we still have no cost-effective alternatives for cars, wheelchairs, scooters, golf carts and UPS systems. The lead-acid battery has retained a market share in applications where newer battery chemistries would either be too expensive.Lead-acid does not lend itself to fast charging. Typical charge time is 8 to 16 hours. A periodic fully saturated charge is essential to prevent sulfation and the battery must always be stored in a charged state. Leaving the battery in a discharged condition causes sulfation and a recharge may not be possible.Finding the ideal charge voltage limit is critical. A high voltage (above 2.40V/cell) produces good battery performance but shortens the service life due to grid corrosion on the positive plate. A low voltage limit is subject to sulfation on the negative plate. Leaving the battery on float charge for a prolonged time does not cause damage.Lead-acid does not like deep cycling. A full discharge causes extra strain and each cycle robs the battery of some service life. This wear-down characteristic also applies to other battery chemistries in varying degrees. To prevent the battery from being stressed through repetitive deep discharge, a larger battery is recommended. Lead-acid is inexpensive but the operational costs can be higher than a nickel-based system if repetitive full cycles are required.Depending on the depth of discharge and operating temperature, the sealed lead-acid provides 200 to 300 discharge/charge cycles. The primary reason for its relatively short cycle life is grid corrosion of the positive electrode, depletion of the active material and expansion of the positive plates. These changes are most prevalent at higher operating temperatures. Cycling does not prevent or reverse the trend.The lead-acid battery has one of the lowest energy densities, making it unsuitable for portable devices. In addition, the performance at low temperatures is marginal. The self-discharge is about 40% per year, one of the best on rechargeable batteries. In comparison, nickel-cadmium self-discharges this amount in three months. The high lead content makes the lead-acid environmentally unfriendly.\nThe service life of a lead-acid battery can, in part, be measured by the thickness of the positive plates. The thicker the plates, the longer the life will be. During charging and discharging, the lead on the plates gets gradually eaten away and the sediment falls to the bottom. The weight of a battery is a good indication of the lead content and the life expectancy. The plates of automotive starter batteries are about 0.040\" (1mm) thick, while the typical golf cart battery will have plates that are between 0.07-0.11\" (1.8- 2.8mm) thick. Forklift batteries may have plates that exceed 0.250\" (6mm). Most industrial flooded deep-cycle batteries use lead-antimony plates. This improves the plate life but increases gassing and water loss.\nDuring the mid 1970s, researchers developed a maintenance-free lead-acid battery that can operate in any position. The liquid electrolyte is gelled into moistened separators and the enclosure is sealed. Safety valves allow venting during charge, discharge and atmospheric pressure changes.Driven by different market needs, two lead-acid systems emerged: The small sealed lead-acid (SLA), also known under the brand name of Gelcell, and the larger Valve-regulated-lead-acid (VRLA). Both batteries are similar. Engineers may argue that the word 'sealed lead-acid' is a misnomer because no rechargeable battery can be totally sealed.\nThe sealed lead-acid battery is rated at a 5-hour (0.2) and 20-hour (0.05C) discharge. Longer discharge times produce higher capacity readings because of lower losses. The lead-acid performs well on high load currents.\nThe AGM is a newer type sealed lead-acid that uses absorbed glass mats between the plates. It is sealed, maintenance-free and the plates are rigidly mounted to withstand extensive shock and vibration. Nearly all AGM batteries are recombinant, meaning they can recombine 99% of the oxygen and hydrogen. There is almost no water is loss.The charging voltages are the same as for other lead-acid batteries. Even under severe overcharge conditions, hydrogen emission is below the 4% specified for aircraft and enclosed spaces. The low self-discharge of 1-3% per month allows long storage before recharging. The AGM costs twice that of the flooded version of the same capacity. Because of durability, German high performance cars use AGM batteries in favor of the flooded type.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-501a: Discharge Characteristics of Li-ion",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-501a-discharge-characteristics-of-li-ion",
        "content": "The early Li-ion battery was considered fragile and unsuitable for high loads. This has changed, and today lithium-based systems stand shoulder to shoulder with the robust nickel and lead chemistries. Two basic types of Li-ion have emerged: The Energy Cell and the Power Cell.\nThe performance of these two battery types is characterized by energy storage, also known as capacity, and current delivery, also known as loading or power. Energy and power characteristics are defined by particle size on the electrodes. Larger particles increase the surface area for maximum capacity and fine material decreases it for high power.\nDecreasing particle size lowers the presence of electrolyte that fills the voids. The volume of electrolyte within the cell determines battery capacity. Decreasing the particle size reduces the voids between the particles, thereby lowering the electrolyte content. Too little electrolyte reduces ionic mobility and affects performance. Think of a drying felt pen that needs recuperating to keep marking papers.\nThe Li-ion Energy Cell is made for maximum capacity to provide long runtimes. The Panasonic NCR18650B Energy Cell (Figure 1) has high capacity but is less enduring when discharged at 2C. At the discharge cutoff of 3.0V/cell, the 2C discharge produces only about 2.3Ah rather than the specified 3.2Ah. This cell is ideal for portable computing and similar light duties.\nThe 3,200mAh Energy Cell is discharged at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C and 2C. The circle at the 3.0V/cell line marks the end-of-discharge point at 2C.\nCold temperature losses:\nThe Panasonic UR18650RX Power Cell (Figure 2) has a moderate capacity but excellent load capabilities. A 10A (5C) discharge has minimal capacity loss at the 3.0V cutoff voltage. This cell works well for applications requiring heavy load current, such as power tools.\nThe 1950mAh Power Cell is discharged at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C and 2C and 10A. All reach the 3.0V/cell cut-off line at about 2000mAh. The Power Cell has moderate capacity but delivers high current.\nCold temperature losses:\nThe Li-ion Power Cell permits a continuous discharge of 10C. This means that an 18650 cell rated at 2,000mAh can provide a continuous load of 20A (30A with Li-phosphate). The superior performance is achieved in part by lowering the internal resistance and by optimizing the surface area of active cell materials. Low resistance enables high current flow with minimal temperature rise. Running at the maximum permissible discharge current, the Li-ion Power Cell heats to about 50ºC (122ºF); the temperature is limited to 60ºC (140ºF).\nTo meet the loading requirements, the pack designer can either use a Power Cell to meet the discharge C-rate requirement or go for the Energy Cell and oversize the pack. The Energy Cell holds about 50 percent more capacity than the Power Cell, but the loading must be reduced. This can be done by oversizing the pack, a method the Tesla EVs use. The battery achieves exceptional runtime but it gets expensive and heavy.\nLithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) is also available in the 18650 format offering high cycle life and superior loading performance, but low specific energy (capacity). Table 3 compares specifications of common lithium-based architectures. More information is on BU-205: Types of Lithium-ion.\nOne of the unique qualities of nickel- and lithium-based batteries is the ability to deliver continuous high power until the battery is exhausted; a fast electrochemical recovery makes it possible. Lead acid is slower and this can be compared to a drying felt pen that works for short markings on paper and then needs rest to replenish the ink. While the recovery is relatively fast on discharge, and this can be seen when cranking the engine, the slow chemical reaction becomes obvious when charging. This only gets worse with age.\nA battery may discharge at a steady load of, say, 0.2C as in a flashlight, but many applications demand momentary loads at double and triple the battery’s C-rating. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) for a mobile phone is such an example (Figure 4). GSM loads the battery with up to 2A at a pulse rate of 577 micro-seconds (μs). This places a large demand on a small battery; however, with a high frequency, the battery begins to behave more like a large capacitor and the battery characteristics change.\nIn terms of longevity, a battery prefers moderate current at a constant discharge rather than a pulsed or momentary high load. Figure 5 demonstrates the decreasing capacity of a NiMH battery at different load conditions from a gentle 0.2C DC discharge, an analog discharge to a pulsed discharge. Most batteries follow a similar pattern in terms of load conditions, including Li-ion.\nFigure 6 examines the number of full cycles a Li-ion Energy Cell can endure when discharged at different C-rates. At a 2C discharge, the battery exhibits far higher stress than at 1C, limiting the cycle count to about 450 before the capacity drops to half the level.\n[1] Source: Panasonic[2] Courtesy of Cadex[3] Source: Zhang (1998)[4] Source: Choi et al (2002)\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-411: Charging from a USB Port",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-411-charging-from-a-usb-port",
        "content": "The Universal Serial Bus (USB) was introduced in 1996 and has since become one of the most widespread and convenient interfaces for electronic devices. Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel, NEC and Nortel contributed to the developments with the goal of simplifying the interconnection of peripheral devices to a PC, as well as to allow a greater data transfer rate than was feasible with earlier interfaces. The USB port can also be used to charge personal devices, but with a current limit of 500mA on the original design, this might have been an afterthought.\nA typical USB network consists of a host that is often a PC and peripherals such as a printer, smartphone or camera. Data streams in both directions but the power is unidirectional and always flows from the host to the device. The host cannot take power from an outside source.\nWith 5V and 500mA available on version USB 1.0 and 2.0, and 900mA on USB 3.0, the USB can charge a small single-cell Li-ion pack. There is, however, a danger of overloading a USB hub when attaching too many gadgets. Charging a device that draws 500mA connected together with other loads will exceed the port’s current limit, leading to a voltage drop and a possible system failure. To prevent overload, some hosts include current-limiting circuits that shut down the supply when overdrawn.\nThe original USB port can only charge a small single-cell Li-ion battery. Charging a 3.6V pack begins by applying a constant current to a voltage peak of 4.20V/cell, at which point the voltage peaks and the current begins to taper off. (See BU-409: Charging Lithium-ion) Due to the voltage drop in the cable and connectors, which is about 350mV, as well as losses in the charging circuit, the 5V supply may not be high enough to fully charge the battery. This is a minor problem; the battery will only charge to about 70 percent state-of-charge and deliver a slightly shorter runtime than with a fully saturated charge. The advantage: Li-ion will last longer if not fully charged.\nStandard A and B USB plugs, as illustrated in Figure 1, feature four pins and a shield. Pin 1 delivers +5VDC and pin 4 forms the ground that also connects to the shield. The two shorter pins, 2 and 3, are marked D- and D+ and carry data. When charging a battery, these pins have no other function than to negotiate current.\nPin 1 carries +5VDC (red wire) and 4 is ground (black wire). The housing connects to the ground and provides shielding. Pin 2 (D-, white wire) and pin 3 (D+, green wire) carry data\nBesides the standard type-A and type-B configurations with 4 pins, there are also the USB Mini-A, Mini-B, Micro-A and Micro-B that include an ID pin to permit detection of which cable end is plugged in. The outer pin-1 is positive and pin-4 is negative. USB cables are generally standard type-A on one end and either type-B, Mini-B or Micro-B on the other. The new type-C connector described later features 24 pins and runs on the USB 3.1 standard.\nUSB 2.0 with a current of 500mA has limitations when charging a larger smartphone or tablet battery. Keeping the smartphone running on a bright screen during charge could result in a net discharge of the battery as the USB cannot satisfy both. Connecting a high-speed disk drive requires more than 500mA and this can create a power issue with the original USB port.\nIn 2008, USB 3.0 relieved the power shortage by upping the current to 900mA. This current ceiling was chosen to prevent the thin ground wire from interfering with high-speed data transfer when drawing a full load.\nWith the need for more power, the USB Implementers Forum released the Battery Charging Specification in 2007 that enables a faster way to charge off a USB host. This led to the dedicated charger port (DCP) serving as a USB charger, delivering currents of 1,500mA and higher by connecting the DCP to an AC outlet or a vehicle. To activate the DCP, the D- and D+ pins are internally connected by a resistor of 200 ohms or less. This distinguishes the DCP from the original USB ports that carry data. Some Apple products limit the charge current by connecting different resistor values to the D+ and D- pins.\nTo support charging and data communication when using the DCP, a Y-shaped cable is offered that connects to the original USB port for data streaming and to the DCP port to satisfy charging needs. This appears like a logical solution but the USB compliance specification states that the “use of a Y-cable is prohibited on any USB peripheral,” meaning that “if a USB peripheral requires more power than allowed by the USB specification to which it is designed, then it must be self-powered.” The Y-cables and the so-called accessory charging adapters (ACA) are being used without apparent difficulties.\nThe question is asked: “Can I cause damage by plugging my device into a USB charger that delivers more current than 500mA and 900mA?” The answer is no. The device only draws what it requires and no more. An analogy is plugging in a lamp or a toaster into an AC wall plug. The lamp requires little current while the toaster goes to the maximum. More power from the USB charger will shorten the charge time.\nIn most cases, turning the computer off also shuts down the USB. Some PCs feature the sleep-and-charge USB port that remains powered on and can be used to charge electronic devices when the computer is off. Sleep-and-charge USB ports might be colored in red or yellow, but no standard exists. Dell adds a lightning bolt icon and calls it the “PowerShare” while Toshiba uses the term “USB Sleep-and-Charge.” The sleep-and-charge USB ports may also be marked with the acronym USB over the drawing of a battery.\nAs with most other successful technologies, USB has spawned several versions of connectors and cables over the years. USB chargers do not always work as advertised and charge times are slow. Incompatibilities between competitive systems exist, willingly or by oversight.\nCompanies overseeing USB standards are aware of the shortcomings and brought out the type-C connector and cable based on the USB 3.1 standard. Rather than using four-pins as in the classic type-A and type-B, the type-C connector has 24 pins and is reversible, meaning it can be plugged in either way. It supports 900mA and, on command, delivers 1.5A and 3.0A over a 5V power bus while streaming data. This results in 7.5 and 15 watt power consumption respectively, as opposed to 2.5W using the original USB (current times voltage = wattage). The type-C can go up to 5A at 12V or 20V, providing 60W and 100W respectively. Figure 2 shows the pinout of the USB Type-C connector.\nSide A and B are mirror images. Some pins are connected in parallel to gain higher power and more reliable connections.\nNew devices come with the USB-C connector and USB 3.1, but consumers beg for two or three regular USB 3.0 ports on their gadgets to support what worked so well in the past. USB 3.1 is backward compatible with USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 and the classic type-A and type-B connectors. While in transition to the type-C, adaptors are available to convert, but expect lower data transfer speeds with adapters than what USB 3.1 offers.\nWith the availability of higher currents and voltages on the Type-C system as compared to the Standard A and B connectors, damage to a device can be afflicted when giving a wrong digital command. The commands may come from a device or an adapter requesting modified power demands. It is advised to only use compatible or trustworthy brands when experimenting with higher voltages and currents in USB connectors.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-409a: Why do Old Li-ion Batteries Take Long to Charge?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-409a-why-do-old-li-ion-batteries-take-long-to-charge",
        "content": "Battery users often ask: “Why does an old Li-ion lake so long to charge?” Indeed, when Li-ion gets older, the battery takes its time to charge even if there is little to fill. We call this the “old-man syndrome.” Figure 1 illustrates the charge time of a new Li-ion with a capacity of 100 percent against an aged pack delivering only 82 percent. Both take roughly 150 minutes to charge.\nBoth packs take roughly 150 minutes to charge. The new pack charges to 1,400mAh (100%) while the aged one only goes to 1,150mAh (82%).\nWhen charging Li-ion, the voltage shoots up similar to lifting a weight with a rubber band. The new pack as demonstrated in Figure 2 is “hungrier” and can take on more “food\" before reaching the 4.20V/cell voltage limit compared to the aged Li-ion that hits V Limit in Stage 1 after only about 60 minutes. In terms of a rubber band analogy, the new battery has less slack than to the aged pack and can accept charge longer before going into saturation.\nThe new Li-ion takes on full charge for 90 minutes while the aged cell reaches 4.20V/cell in 60 minutes\nFigure 3 demonstrates the different saturation times in Stage 2 as the current trails from the fully regulated current to about 0.05C to trigger ready mode. The trailing on a good battery is short and is prolonged on an aged pack. This explains the longer charge time of an older Li-ion with less capacity. An analogy is a young athlete running a sprint with little or no slow-down towards the end, while the old man gets out of breath and begins walking, prolonging the time to reach the goal.\nThe new cell stays in full-charge longer than the old cell and has a shorter current trail.\nA common aging effect of Li-ion is loss of charge transfer capability. This is caused by the formation of passive materials on the electrodes, which inhibits the flow of free electrons. This reduces the porosity on the electrodes, decreases the surface area, lowers the lower ionic conductivity and raises migration resistance. The aging phenomenon is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nThe health of a battery is based on these three fundamental attributes:\nThe charge signature reveals valuable health indicators of Li-ion. A good battery absorbs most of the charge in Stage 1 before reaching 4.20V/cell and the trailing in Stage 2 is short. “Lack of hunger” on a Li-ion can be attributed to a battery being partially charged; exceptionally long trailing times relates to a battery with low capacity, high internal resistance and/or elevated self-discharge.\nAlgorithms can be developed that compare Stage 1 and Stage 2 based on capacity and state-of-charge. Anomalies, such as low capacity and elevated self-discharge can be identified by setting acceptance thresholds. Cadex is developing chargers with algorithms that will provide diagnostic functions. Such advancement will promote the lone charger into a supervisory position to provide quality assurance in batteries without added logistics.\n[1] Courtesy: Cadex Electronics Inc.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Making Battery State-of-health Transparent",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/making-battery-state-of-health-transparent",
        "content": "Medical technicians have discovered that most defibrillators batteries had over 90% capacity left when the two-year expiry date called for replacement. This had led to discarding perfectly good batteries, escalating operational costs and stressing the environment. A manager of the Energy Storage Research Program at DOE reported that “every year roughly one million usable lithium-ion batteries are sent for recycling.” In spite of this frivolous replacement policy, a US FDA survey says that “up to 50% of service calls in hospitals surveyed relate to battery issues.” Healthcare professionals at AAMI say further that “battery management emerged as a top 10 medical device challenge.” A bio-med whistle-blower said, “Batteries are the most abused components. Staff care little about them and only do the bare minimum. References to battery maintenance are vague and hidden inside service manuals.”\nBatteries should receive the same treatment as a critical part in a machine or an aircraft where wear and tear falls under strict maintenance guidelines. This is not happening and batteries receive special privileges, partly because they are considered “uncontrollable.” Batteries can and should be checked and this is possible with a battery analyzer that checks capacity and internal resistance. Capacity refers to storage capability governing runtime and internal resistance enables power delivery.\nBattery analyzers have been used for many years but checking large volume of batteries with a full charge/discharge cycle is not always practical and new test methods are being developed. One such advancement is Diagnostic Battery Management (DBM) by Cadex that provides an instant status report by reading the FCC (full charge capacity) of a smart battery.\nFCC readings are in- and out-flowing coulombs. Stored in the SMBus battery for instant readout, FCC represents battery state-of-health (SoH). As with most tracking methods, however, inaccuracies develop with time because of random discharges. This can be solved by giving the battery a PASS when the FCC dwells above the user-set capacity threshold that is typically 80%. Calibration is required if FCC falls below this number. A calibration applies a charge/discharge/charge cycle to read the capacity of the chemical battery. If the capacity is below 80%, a replacement is needed. Such a system doubles battery life and improves system reliability as it allows the full service life of each battery.\nDBM installed in a Cadex charger or analyzer makes battery performance transparent to users (chart on right). Custom battery adapters enable easy interface to different battery types and the Wide Area Network displays data to fleet managers.\nPlacing an SMBus battery into a charger or analyzer provides an instant SoH readout. Each service updates the reading to maintain history. Come budget time, the operator simply calls up packs with low capacity for replacement. This is normally 80%. Spare charge at the end of a day can also be verified and a battery should have a minimum of 10% reserve. If the spare charge is tight, the pass/fail threshold should be raised; with plenty of reserve the battery can drop to a lower capacity threshold before a replacement is needed. Knowing the capacity and remaining charge assures a reliable energy delivery for all applications. Equally important, DBM establishes a critical balance between risk management and economy.\nRisk reduction is not the only benefit. A modern battery analyzer typically pays back in less than one year by keeping the battery in service longer and reducing unexpected failures. Device manufacturers support battery maintenance because it eliminates under-performing batteries and reduces the number of devices sent for repair. Well-performing batteries reflect positively on the equipment; a win-win situation for all parties. Best of all, the DBM is easy to implement and operate. The availability of DBM in Cadex battery analyzers and chargers is scheduled for 2017.\nOnly with DBM does the battery become a reliable, safe, cost efficient and environmentally sustainable power source. Building a super battery is incomplete without considering workforce-to-retirement. DBM does this by combining known technologies into a powerful supervisory system.

        "content": "As the world electrifies, new demands are placed on the battery. Clean energy must have the same performance transparency as traditional power sources burning fossil fuel, but we realize that battery diagnostics is lagging behind. Without mature ways to assess battery state-of-health (SoH), battery users ask: “Will my battery die quietly or quit with a bang?”\nLesson learned reminds us of the railway tracks laid across the continent in mid-1800 that were too frail and needed replacement with double the ties to carry heavy trains traveling at high speed.\nAviation also learned a lesson with early jet travel. In the 1950s, the elegant Comet developed cracks at rivet points around window frames after 9,000 flying hours that caused the fuselage to disintegrate and the plane to crash. Reinforcement with round windows fixes the problem with modern planes.\nIn the 1960s, industry made milestone by introducing Reliability-centered Maintenance (RCM) with strategic maintenance schedules on machinery. RCM was first applied on the Boeing 747 to improve air safety. These practices then spilled into other industries, such as nuclear plants, defense, and railways.\nBatteries for critical uses require innovative testing to fully utilize each battery and replace them before failure. One of these test methods is electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), also known as Spectro™.\nA frequency scan produces a Nyquist plot representing the electrochemical evidence of a battery. The signature is compared with a matrix of batteries of the same model with varying performances, a concept used in face recognition using AI.\nThe frequency scan ranging from 2,000Hz to 4Hz is minimally invasive. Test time is 30 seconds, longer with a large battery with an extended scan down to 0.1Hz.\nThe scanned data goes through filtering and magnitude extraction. Modelling and data fusion correlate the values to derive capacity, CCA, SoC and other readings. Matrices are available for lead acid and Li-ion batteries.\nCapacity estimation of portable Li-ion batteries is mostly done by a System Management Bus (SMBus). With Usable Battery Energy known, the battery user must now establish the Minimum Operational Reserve Energy (MORE). Deep Battery Diagnostics (DBD) makes this possible by setting the Target Selector to a capacity threshold that delivers sufficient Leftover Charge for a given daily routine. DBD also evaluates predictive fade based on manufacturer’s specifications. Compiling the data as illustrated in Figure 5 leads to RUL, the ultimate disclosure to battery users.\nThe DBD algorithm can be built into service devices, such as chargers, battery analyzers and monitoring systems serving batteries for portable, mobile, auto and stationary applications.\nModern battery chargers are no longer built to work in standalone mode. Figure 6 illustrates connecting the charger or analyzer to a host in Level 2 and Cloud Analytics in Level 3 to form a powerful battery supervisory servicing smart batteries. Capacity assessment with “dumb” batteries is also possible with the parser technology.\nModern battery-care systems must be cost-effective and simple to operate. Figure 6 illustrates functions of a fully extended system starting with the lone charger. Scalability makes a battery fleet transparent with ability to set the ‘sweet spot’ between high reliability and long battery life.\nUser: Level 1In standalone mode, the SoH Light reveals capacity when inserting a smart battery. Green is a go; amber requests calibration and replacement if capacity cannot be restored.\nSupervisor: Level 2With a PC, the supervisor checks Leftover Charge that should be between 10–20% at the end of a day on the worst battery. Adjustment is by the Target Selector.\nCloud Analytics: Level 3Cloud Analytics offers trend analysis on battery fleets based on Leftover Charge, Energy Used and Remaining Useful Life.\nThe Fishbowl makes battery state-of-health transparent with Leftover Charge marked in percentage. The outer ring reveals state-of-charge that moves clock-wise with charge and counter-clockwise with discharge. The hanging black ceiling tracks capacity that slowly drops towards the set Target Selector redline as the battery ages. Touching the Status Dome displays battery data that includes battery manufacturing date, ratings, as well as cell mismatch with some smart batteries. A status message discloses the readiness of a battery.\nLeftover Charge is set by the Target Selector. An analogy is an aircraft carrying enough fuel for landing.\nIf Leftover Charge is low, the target capacity should be set higher to increase reserve energy for a given application. If consistently high, the setting can be lowered to keep batteries in service longer.\nRecommended target capacity settings of fleet batteries are:\n85-90%: Critical mission; fewer batteries will pass\n80%: Default; golden average that works for most uses\n60-70%: Relaxed duty; batteries can be kept in service longer\nModern chargers with Target Selector may be set to different settings. For example, 90% will only pass batteries for critical uses. Once the capacity reduces, the battery is placed into the 80% charger for general use. With further fade, this battery is then kept in the 70% charger for less critical uses. Such a system lowers cost of ownership without sacrificing system reliability und lowering environmental concerns.\nA DOE official said: “Every year roughly one million usable lithium-ion batteries are sent for recycling.” The US Army also discards tons of batteries, in part due to inactivity. Roughly 75% of vehicles on standby are driven less than 3,000 miles per year, causing battery sulfation, a film buildup that occurs when a lead acid battery is deprived of a full charge. Sulation can often be reversed if serviced in time.\nRecords disclose that batteries in armored vehicles were being replaced every 13 months on average, breaking the expected life expectancy of 6 to 8 years. In fiscal 2016 alone, the Department of Defense replaced more than 373,000 batteries in a pool of 400,000 at a cost of over $80 million.

        "title": "BU-302: Series and Parallel Battery Configurations",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-302-series-and-parallel-battery-configurations",
        "content": "BU-302: Configuraciones de Baterías en Serie y Paralelo (Español)\nBatteries achieve the desired operating voltage by connecting several cells in series; each cell adds its voltage potential to derive at the total terminal voltage. Parallel connection attains higher capacity by adding up the total ampere-hour (Ah).\nSome packs may consist of a combination of series and parallel connections. Laptop batteries commonly have four 3.6V Li-ion cells in series to achieve a nominal voltage 14.4V and two in parallel to boost the capacity from 2,400mAh to 4,800mAh. Such a configuration is called 4s2p, meaning four cells in series and two in parallel. Insulating foil between the cells prevents the conductive metallic skin from causing an electrical short.\nMost battery chemistries lend themselves to series and parallel connection. It is important to use the same battery type with equal voltage and capacity (Ah) and never to mix different makes and sizes. A weaker cell would cause an imbalance. This is especially critical in a series configuration because a battery is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. An analogy is a chain in which the links represent the cells of a battery connected in series (Figure 1).\nA weak cell may not fail immediately but will get exhausted more quickly than the strong ones when on a load. On charge, the low cell fills up before the strong ones because there is less to fill and it remains in over-charge longer than the others. On discharge, the weak cell empties first and gets hammered by the stronger brothers. Cells in multi-packs must be matched, especially when used under heavy loads. (See BU-803a: Cell Mismatch, Balancing).\nThe single-cell configuration is the simplest battery pack; the cell does not need matching and the protection circuit on a small Li-ion cell can be kept simple. Typical examples are mobile phones and tablets with one 3.60V Li-ion cell. Other uses of a single cell are wall clocks, which typically use a 1.5V alkaline cell, wristwatches and memory backup, most of which are very low power applications.\nThe nominal cell voltage for a nickel-based battery is 1.2V, alkaline is 1.5V; silver-oxide is 1.6V and lead acid is 2.0V. Primary lithium batteries range between 3.0V and 3.9V. Li-ion is 3.6V; Li-phosphate is 3.2V and Li-titanate is 2.4V.\nLi-manganese and other lithium-based systems often use cell voltages of 3.7V and higher. This has less to do with chemistry than promoting a higher watt-hour (Wh), which is made possible with a higher voltage. The argument goes that a low internal cell resistance keeps the voltage high under load. For operational purposes these cells go as 3.6V candidates. (See BU-303 Confusion with Voltages)\nPortable equipment needing higher voltages use battery packs with two or more cells connected in series. Figure 2 shows a battery pack with four 3.6V Li-ion cells in series, also known as 4S, to produce 14.4V nominal. In comparison, a six-cell lead acid string with 2V/cell will generate 12V, and four alkaline with 1.5V/cell will give 6V.\nIf you need an odd voltage of, say, 9.50 volts, connect five lead acid, eight NiMH or NiCd, or three Li-ion in series. The end battery voltage does not need to be exact as long as it is higher than what the device specifies. A 12V supply might work in lieu of 9.50V. Most battery-operated devices can tolerate some over-voltage; the end-of-discharge voltage must be respected, however.\nHigh voltage batteries keep the conductor size small. Cordless power tools run on 12V and 18V batteries; high-end models use 24V and 36V. Most e-bikes come with 36V Li-ion, some are 48V. The car industry wanted to increase the starter battery from 12V (14V) to 36V, better known as 42V, by placing 18 lead acid cells in series. Logistics of changing the electrical components and arcing problems on mechanical switches derailed the move.\nSome mild hybrid cars run on 48V Li-ion and use DC-DC conversion to 12V for the electrical system. Starting the engine is often done by a separate 12V lead acid battery. Early hybrid cars ran on a 148V battery; electric vehicles are typically 450–500V. Such a battery needs more than 100 Li-ion cells connected in series.\nHigh-voltage batteries require careful cell matching, especially when drawing heavy loads or when operating at cold temperatures. With multiple cells connected in a string, the possibility of one cell failing is real and this would cause a failure. To prevent this from happening, a solid state switch in some large packs bypasses the failing cell to allow continued current flow, albeit at a lower string voltage.\nCell matching is a challenge when replacing a faulty cell in an aging pack. A new cell has a higher capacity than the others, causing an imbalance. Welded construction adds to the complexity of the repair, and this is why battery packs are commonly replaced as a unit.\nHigh-voltage batteries in electric vehicles, in which a full replacement would be prohibitive, divide the pack into modules, each consisting of a specific number of cells. If one cell fails, only the affected module is replaced. A slight imbalance might occur if the new module is fitted with new cells. (See BU-910: How to Repair a Battery Pack)\nFigure 3 illustrates a battery pack in which “cell 3” produces only 2.8V instead of the full nominal 3.6V. With depressed operating voltage, this battery reaches the end-of-discharge point sooner than a normal pack. The voltage collapses and the device turns off with a “Low Battery” message.\nBatteries in drones and remote controls for hobbyist requiring high load current often exhibit an unexpected voltage drop if one cell in a string is weak. Drawing maximum current stresses frail cells, leading to a possible crash. Reading the voltage after a charge does not identify this anomaly; examining the cell-balance or checking the capacity with a battery analyzer will.\nThere is a common practice to tap into the series string of a lead acid array to obtain a lower voltage. Heavy duty equipment running on a 24V battery bank may need a 12V supply for an auxiliary operation and this voltage is conveniently available at the half-way point.\nTapping is not recommended because it creates a cell imbalance as one side of the battery bank is loaded more than the other. Unless the disparity can be corrected by a special charger, the side effect is a shorter battery life. Here is why:\nWhen charging an imbalanced lead acid battery bank with a regular charger, the undercharged section tends to develop sulfation as the cells never receive a full charge. The high voltage section of the battery that does not receive the extra load tends to get overcharged and this leads to corrosion and loss of water due to gassing. Please note that the charger charging the entire string looks at the average voltage and terminates the charge accordingly.\nTapping is also common on Li-ion and nickel-based batteries and the results are similar to lead acid: reduced cycle life. (See BU-803a: Cell Matching and Balancing) Newer devices use a DC-DC converter to deliver the correct voltage. Electric and hybrid vehicles, alternatively, use a separate low-voltage battery for the auxiliary system.\nIf higher currents are needed and larger cells are not available or do not fit the design constraint, one or more cells can be connected in parallel. Most battery chemistries allow parallel configurations with little side effect. Figure 4 illustrates four cells connected in parallel in a P4 arrangement. The nominal voltage of the illustrated pack remains at 3.60V, but the capacity (Ah) and runtime are increased fourfold.\nA cell that develops high resistance or opens is less critical in a parallel circuit than in a series configuration, but a failing cell will reduce the total load capability. It’s like an engine only firing on three cylinders instead of on all four. An electrical short, on the other hand, is more serious as the faulty cell drains energy from the other cells, causing a fire hazard. Most so-called electrical shorts are mild and manifest themselves as elevated self-discharge.\nA total short can occur through reverse polarization or dendrite growth. Large packs often include a fuse that disconnects the failing cell from the parallel circuit if it were to short. Figure 5 illustrates a parallel configuration with one faulty cell.\nA weak cell will not affect the voltage but provide a low runtime due to reduced capacity. A shorted cell could cause excessive heat and become a fire hazard. On larger packs a fuse prevents high current by isolating the cell.\nThe series/parallel configuration shown in Figure 6 enables design flexibility and achieves the desired voltage and current ratings with a standard cell size. The total power is the sum of voltage times current; a 3.6V (nominal) cell multiplied by 3,400mAh produces 12.24Wh. Four 18650 Energy Cells of 3,400mAh each can be connected in series and parallel as shown to get 7.2V nominal and a total of 48.96Wh. A combination with 8 cells would produce 97.92Wh, the allowable limit for carry on an aircraft or shipped without Class 9 hazardous material. (See BU-704a: Shipping Lithium-based Batteries by Air) The slim cell allows flexible pack design but a protection circuit is needed.\nLi-ion lends itself well to series/parallel configurations but the cells need monitoring to stay within voltage and current limits. Integrated circuits (ICs) for various cell combinations are available to supervise up to 13 Li-ion cells. Larger packs need custom circuits, and this applies to e-bike batteries, hybrid cars and the Tesla Model 85 that devours over 7000 18650 cells to make up the 90kWh pack.\nThe battery industry specifies the number of cells in series first, followed by the cells placed in parallel. An example is 2s2p. With Li-ion, the parallel strings are always made first; the completed parallel units are then placed in series. Li-ion is a voltage based system that lends itself well for parallel formation. Combining several cells into a parallel and then adding the units serially reduces complexity in terms of voltages control for pack protection.\nBuilding series strings first and then placing them in in parallel may be more common with NiCd packs to satisfy the chemical shuttle mechanism that balances charge at the top of charge. “2s2p” is common; white papers have been issued that refer to 2p2s when a serial string is paralleled.\nPositive Temperature Coefficient Switches (PTC) and Charge Interrupt Devices (CID) protect the battery from overcurrent and excessive pressure. While recommended for safety in a smaller 2- or 3-cell pack with serial and parallel configuration, these protection devices are often being omitted in larger multi-cell batteries, such as those for power tool. The PTC and CID work as expected to switch of the cell on excessive current and internal cell pressure; however the shutdown occurs in cascade format. While some cells may go offline early, the load current causes excess current on the remaining cells. Such overload condition could lead to a thermal runaway before the remaining safety devices activate.\nSome cells have built-in PCT and CID; these protection devices can also be added retroactively. The design engineer must be aware than any safety device is subject to failure. In addition, the PTC induces a small internal resistance that reduces the load current.

I have (2) JY Power hp-40s in my vehicle. They're connected together using aluminum bars.. +-+, ---.  At resting the voltage on both is 13 volts (approximately). Once I start the vehicle 1 jumps immediately to 14.7 (approximately) and the other stays at resting. When I turn the stereo system on, I can watch the battery monitor (wired in to each battery)  on the battery at 14.7 fluctuate from pulling power. The battery that sits at resting does not fluctuate. I've double and triple checked everything and I'm at a huge stand still.  Please help. Thanks in advance.\nAs u have shown the battery connection but would like to ask you that if we want to make a circuit for 6v 3A solar\nhai sir, i have a doubt about 18650 3.7v batteries in 7 x 3 position One side both positive and negative two line short..another side oppsite line two sides shorted, WHY?. pls answer me sir\nthankyou\nA circuit consists of 2 series connected batteries; the positive terminals of the batteries are connected to each other; the negative terminals connects the rest of the circuit. One battery is rated 100V and the other, 350V. This series connection is further connected to a single series load resistor. After connecting the load resistor, a potential difference of 228,7 V was observed across the load. A current of 15,25 A was measured. Determine the internal resistance values of the batteries if the volt drop in the 100V cell is 10.7V.\nIn Figure 6 above, if I have a NiCd cell batteries, which configuration is better, series all cells then parallel or parallel both then connect in series. Meaning in between cell there is no jumper to parallel two cell or batt. It's like 2s then parallel as compared to 2p then series it.\nThanks.\nThe nominal cell voltage for a nickel-based Hi. I had the understanding earlier on that Li-ion are of many types including Li-posphate, Li-cobalt etc but this statement in the sixth paragraph seems to suggest that Li-ion isn't a name for a group of batteries but is a specific battery chemistry \"Primary lithium batteries range between 3.0V and 3.9V. Li-ion is 3.6V; Li-phosphate is 3.2V and Li-titanate is 2.4V.\"\nHow48V,20AH lead acid battery can replace 60V,24AH LiFePO4 battery.\nThe nomenclature proposed above is not optimal.  A better system is to place the first connection first, and the second connection second.  For example:\n4P16S is a pack such that cells are connected in groups of 4 in parallel, and 16 of those groups are connected in series.\n16S4P is a pack such that cells are connected in groups of 16 in series, and 4 of those groups are connected in parallel.\nAlso, using an example of 4S4P is ambiguous.  It would be better to use unequal values of S and P to clearly illustrate the point.\nLooking at all this explanation I gained more knowledge and skills and experience how to connect my solar to a battery.\nOK, this new format looks better.

        "content": "No practical method exists to quantify all conditions of a battery in a short, comprehensive test. State-of-health (SoH) cannot be measured per se, it can only be estimated to various degrees of accuracy based on available symptoms. If the symptoms are vague or not present, a reliable measurement is not possible. When testing a battery, three SoH indicators must be evaluated:\nBatteries come in many conditions and a charge can easily mask a symptom allowing a weak battery to perform well. Likewise, a strong battery with low charge shares similarities with a pack that exhibits capacity loss. Battery characteristics are also swayed by a recent charge, discharge or long storage. These mood swings must be clearly identified when testing batteries.\nFigure 1 demonstrates the usable battery capacity in volume that can be filled with a liquid, permanent capacity loss in the form of “rock content” that reduces the volume, and internal resistance in tap size symbolizing current flow\nsymbolizing the usable capacity, the empty portion that can be refilled, permanent capacity loss as “rock content” and the tap symbolizing power delivery as part of internal resistance.\nThe leading health indicator of a battery is capacity, a measurement that represents energy storage. A new battery should deliver 100 percent of the rated capacity. This means a 5Ah pack should deliver five amperes for 1 hour. If the battery quits after 30 minutes, then the capacity is only 50 percent. Capacity also supports warranty obligations with a replacement due when falling below 80 percent. Most importantly, capacity defines end of battery life.\nLead acid starts at about 85 percent and increases in capacity through use before the long and gradual decrease begins(See BU-701: How to Prime Batteries) Lithium-ion starts at peak and begins its decline immediately, albeit very slowly. Nickel-based batteries need priming to reach full capacity when new or after a long storage.\nManufacturers base device specifications on a new battery. This state is temporary and does not represent a battery in real-life situations because fading begins from the day it is made. The decrease in performance only becomes visible once the shine of a new device has worn off and daily routines are being taken for granted. An analogy is an aging man whose endurance begins to wear off after the most productive years (Figure 2)\nFew people know when to replace a battery; some are replaced too early but most are kept too long.\nKnowing when to replace a battery is a blur for many battery users. When asked, “At what capacity do you replace the battery?” most reply in confusion, “I beg your pardon?” Few are familiar with the term capacity as a measurement of runtime, and fewer know that capacity is used as a threshold for retiring batteries. In many organizations, battery problems only become apparent with increased breakdowns, which may be caused by a lack of battery maintenance.\nBattery retirement depends on the application. Organizations using battery analyzers typically set the replacement threshold at 80 percent(See BU-909: Battery Test Equipment) Some industries can keep the battery longer than others and a toss arises between “what if” and economics. Scanning devices in warehouses may go as low as 60 percent and still provide a full day’s work. A starter battery in a car still cranks well at 40 percent, but that is cutting it thin.\nAny battery-operated mission must plan for a worst-case scenario. Although manufacturers include some reserve when specifying runtime, the amount is seldom clearly defined. Critical missions demand tighter tolerances and the battery must be replaced sooner than when a sudden failure can be tolerated(See BU-503: How to Calculate Battery Runtime)\nMedical and military devices are considered critical and batteries are often replaced too soon. Rather than testing them, device manufacturers prefer to use a cycle count or a date stamp to mandate retirement. To cover all eventualities, the service duration on a date stamp is often limited to 2 or 3 years.\nMedical technicians have discovered that many batteries for defibrillators have more than 90 percent capacity left when the mandatory 2-year date-stamp expires, replacing perfectly good medical batteries prematurely. In spite of this apparent waste, a US FDA survey says that “up to 50 percent of service calls in hospitals surveyed relate to battery issues.” Healthcare professionals at AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instruments) say further that “battery management emerged as a top 10 medical device challenge.”(See BU:803: Can batteries be Restored)\nAnother application where battery capacity is important is in a drone. With a good battery, the device may be specified to fly for 60 minutes, but if unknown to mission control, the capacity has dropped from 100 to 75 percent, the flying time is reduced to 45 minutes. This could crash the $25,000 vehicle when required to negotiate a second landing approach. By marking the capacity on each pack as part of battery maintenance, batteries delivering close to 100 percent capacity can be assigned for long hauls while older packs may be sent for shorter errands. This allows the full use of each battery and establishes a sound retirement policy.\nMany batteries and portable devices include a fuel gauge that shows the remaining energy. A full charge always shows 100 percent, whether the battery is new or faded. This creates a false sense of security by anticipating that a faded battery showing fully charge will deliver the same runtime as a new one. Batteries with fuel gauges only indicate SoC and not the capacity.\nBattery failure is not only limited to portable devices. Starter batteries in vehicles have also become failure-prone. In 2008, ADAC (Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club e.V.) stated that 40 percent of all roadside automotive failures are battery-related. A 2013 ADAC report says that battery problems have quadrupled between 1996 and 2010.\nADAC, Europe’s largest automotive club, says further that each third breakdown involves either a discharged or defective battery. The report, published by German Motorwelt in May 2013, also mentions that only a few starter batteries reach the average age of five years, and this applies to all cars. The statistic was derived from the more than four million breakdowns that the ADAC car club typically receives in a year. The study only included newer cars; service-prone vehicles more than 6 years old were excluded.\nBCI (Battery Council International) reports similar results. A 2010 study by the BCI technical subcommittee revealed that grid-related failures had increased by 9 percent from 5 years earlier. Experts suspect that higher electrical demands in modern vehicles lead to higher failure rates(See BU-804: How to Prolong Lead-acid Batteries)\nBattery failure in Japan is the largest single complaint among new car owners. The average car is driven 13km (8 miles) per day and mostly in congested cities. The most common reason for battery failure is undercharge, developing sulfation. (See BU-804b: Sulfation and How to Prevent it.) Battery performance is key; problems during the warranty period are recorded as component failure and tarnish customer satisfaction.\nA German manufacturer of luxury cars reported that one in two starter batteries returned under warranty had no problem. A German manufacturer of high-quality starter batteries stated that factory defects account for only 5 to 7 percent of all warranty claims. Battery failure during the warranty period is seldom a factory defect; driving habits are the main culprits. A careful assessment with advanced battery test instruments capable of looking at various failure symptoms can greatly reduce warranty claims.\nThe mobile phone industry experiences similar battery warranty issues. Nine out of ten batteries returned are said to have no problems. Rather than trouble-shooting a customer complaint because of lower than expected runtime, the clerk simply replaces the battery. This burdens the vendor without solving the problem; it may also lead to repeat complaints.\nPart of the problem lies in the difficulty of testing batteries, and this applies to storefronts, hospitals, combat fields and service garages. Battery rapid-test methods seem to dwell in medieval times, and this is especially evident when comparing advancements on other fronts. We don’t even have a reliable method to estimate state-of-charge, which is based mostly on voltage and coulomb counting. Assessing capacity, the leading health indicator of a battery, dwells further behind. Measuring the open circuit voltage and checking the internal resistance do not provide conclusive evidence of battery state-of-health.\nThe battery user may ask, “Why is the industry lagging so far behind?” The answer is simple: “Battery diagnostics are complex.” As there is no single analytical device to assess the health of a person, nor are instruments available that can quickly and reliably check the state-of-health of a battery. Like the human body, batteries can have multiple hidden deficiencies that no singular test method can identify with certainly.\nA dead battery is easy to check and all testers are 100 percent accurate. The challenge comes in evaluating a battery in the 80–100 percent performance range while on duty. Regulators struggle to introduce battery test procedures. This is mostly due to the unavailability of suitable technology that can assess a battery on the fly. The battery is labeled “uncontrollable” for good reason; this gives it immunity.\nThe battery world devotes much effort on the super battery, but this improved battery is incomplete without being able to check performance while in service. Improving performance and reliability does not rest in a better battery alone, but in tracking the performance as it ages.\nProfessor Mark Orazem compares the complexity of testing batteries with the Indian tale in which blind men touch an elephant to learn what it is (Figure 3). Because each man only feels a part of the body, disagreements arise among them. Battery testing is complex even for the sighted man but progress is being made. Better technologies will eventually immerge.\nStory of blind men trying to figure out an elephant through touch. The tale provides insight into the relativism and opaqueness of a subject matter, such as a battery.\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Isidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc. as well the author of Battery University.\nFascinated with electronics during his school years, Isidor built and sold broadcast radios that ran with no external power source – they only required an antenna and a ground wire (no battery needed).\nDuring his apprenticeship, he invented an internal combustion engine that was based on continuous propulsion. Felix Wankel in Germany, the inventor of the Wankel Rotary Engine, reviewed the drawings and theory of operation and replied that while the design was unique and original, manufacturing would be too expensive for commercialization. The continuous propulsion ICE invented by Isidor was never built.\nAfter graduation, Isidor left his native Switzerland and immigrated to Canada to pursue a career in electronics. When the anticipated job opportunities did not materialize, he pooled his savings and started his own company. In a small room at his house he worked on product developments long into the night while raising a large family.\nIsidor conceived the business model in the early 1980s while working at General Electric. NiCd batteries caused many failures then, and while repairing two-way radios he discovered a way to rejuvenate these “memory” prone batteries. In his spare time at home, he developed a battery analyzer that featured the proprietary “recondition” program. To prevent conflict of interest with GE, Isidor quit his job and went on his own. The beginning was challenging but with perseverance, his company Cadex Electronics, eventually flourished.\nIsidor knew early on that manufacturing battery analyzers to reverse memory had a limited market, and in 2000 Cadex began researching battery diagnostics that included rapid-test methods. The development secured several patents and established a leading position in the field of battery diagnostics and monitoring. Spectro™, one of the inventions, is currently the only commercial device that employs electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to estimate the capacity of a battery. Most competitive test systems use the simpler internal resistance method. Batteries have improved and resistance alone no longer provides reliable health indications.\nRealizing the importance of batteries for an increasing number of users from all walks of life, Isidor began to write articles that have been published in roughly 300 trade magazines worldwide. Many articles were translated into different languages and he earned a writer’s award.\nThe growing interest in batteries enticed Isidor to publish a book entitled, Batteries in a Portable World: A Handbook on Rechargeable Batteries for Non-Engineers. The first release dates back to 1997; a larger second larger edition arrived in 2001 and subsequent editions followed. The book became a bestseller.\nIsidor wanted to share his battery knowledge with a broader audience and in 2003 he began publishing the material on the web. Today, Battery University is an open teaching resource for engineers, academia, media, as well as students and ordinary battery users.\nThe website is continuously being updated to reflect advancements in battery technologies and how to apply them in industries. As the battery improves, Isidor believes that the use of the battery will further grow to eventually become a partial alternative to fossil fuel in the electric powertrain, drones and wheeled mobility. This, he says, has much room for improvement.\nIsidor is the father of five grown children and lives in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby. To reduce greenhouse gases and keep fit he commutes the 10km (6 miles) trip to work by bicycle, rain or shine. The downhill ride to the shores of the Fraser River where the Cadex Headquarters is located is easy; climbing the hill in the evening takes a bit more effort. He believes in human propulsion and has not yet switched to an e-bike. He wants to keep the fossil fuel that is so frivolously being burned in the ground to lower green-house gas and enable future generations to enjoy.\nIsidor and the Cadex team take pride in sharing battery knowledge and are open to suggestions.

        "content": "Battery testing can be guesswork and the lack of effective test methods results in batteries being replaced too soon or too late (mostly too late). Some batteries are swapped repeatedly without knowing the cause of failure, but most are left untouched until a failure occurs.\nThe market is saturated with battery testers. Most read only voltage and internal resistance and don’t work all that well. They do find a dead or dying battery; but so does the user. Batteries have improved and resistance-related failures are isolated. This makes single-dimensional impedance that only read resistance more or less obsolete. The solution lies in two-dimensional methods, but more on this later.\nThe leading health indicator of a battery is capacity, a value that is difficult to appraise. Many battery testers claim to measure capacity, but this is not possible with voltage and resistance alone, nor will a load test achieve this. Advertising features that lay outside the equipment’s capabilities is misleading and confuses the industry into believing that multifaceted results are attainable with basic test methods.\nBattery diagnostics is complex. We don’t even have a reliable method to measure state-of-charge (SoC). Most rely on voltage and coulomb counting; assessing capacity lags far behind. Batteries cannot be measured per se; their health can only be predicted or estimated using indirect measurements. This is synonymous with the weatherman predicting the weather. All findings are estimations with various degrees of accuracy.\nBattery testing is not new. The carbon pile introduced in the 1980s applies a load for a short duration. The voltage drop reveals the internal resistance and current flow assures cranking ability. The carbon pile cannot estimate capacity but a skilled mechanic can assess a battery on its kinetic behavior.\nThe AC conductance meter, also known as impedance tester, appeared in 1992 and was hailed as a breakthrough. The device injects an AC signal to measure the internal resistance. Today, these testers check the CCA of starter batteries and verify the resistive change on UPS batteries. While small and easier to use, these instruments cannot measure capacity.\nCritical progress has been made with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS is not new. Size, high cost, long test times and required skills to interpret results have restricted their technology to lab environments. To facilitate capacity estimation, Cadex extended EIS and developed multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, or Spectro™. The heart of Spectro™ is a patented algorithm that performs 40 million transactions while scanning the battery with 20–2,000 Hz low amplitude signals. Figure 1 illustrates the Spectro CA-12 providing capacity, CCA, and SoC in 15 second test.\nFigure 1: Spectro CA-12 handheld battery testerMeasures capacity, CCA and state-of-charge in 15 seconds by injecting20–2,000 Hertz signals. Forms platform for many lead acid tests.Patented technology\nConfiguration is by matrix selection. A matrix is a multi-dimensional lookup table against which the measured readings are compared. Text recognition, fingerprint identification and visual imaging operate on a similar principle. The Spectro™ system uses three types of matrix types: The battery-specific matrix serves a designated battery model and provides capacity readings in the form of a number, the generic matrix accommodates a battery group and gives a pass/fail on a capacity threshold of 40%, and the application-defined matrix inspects performance characteristics of new batteries.\nBattery matrices for capacity measurements are created by scanning 10 or more batteries of the same model with different capacity levels. The SoC-matrix is made by reading batteries with different SoC levels, and the performance-matrix is derived by taking a snapshot of a good, marginal and poor battery from the assembly line. Batteries are scanned with the CA-12 and the data is sent to Cadex by the Internet for matrix assembly.\nSpectro™ forms a platform that assesses most anomalies and characteristics of lead acid batteries with a single scan. Table 1 summarizes these functions.\nSpectro Platform\nFunction\nApplication\nConfiguration\nSpectro CA-12(Non-specified base unit)\nReads battery capacity, CCA and SoC in numbers\nCars, trucks, marine, RV, military, UPS\nRequires battery-specific matrix\nSpectro CA-12 GA\nClassifies battery on a 40% capacity threshold, reads CCA\nAutomotive garages\nRuns on generic matrix for starter batteries\nSpectro CA-12 DC\nReads battery capacity, SoC, and resistance in numbers\nGolf cars, AWP, floor cleaners, scooters\nRequires battery-specific matrix\nSpectro CA-12 SoC\nMeasures SoC by impedance independent of voltage\nVehicle assembly, transport, showroom\nNeeds SoC matrix\nSpectro CA-12 QA\nVerifies capacity as part of manufacturing and acceptance\nBattery fabrication, warranty claims\nRequires QA matrix\nSpectro CA-12 NQ\nChecks battery by Nyquist; open platform\nLaboratory, QA, field service\nEvaluation by plot examination\nTable 1: Spectro™ platform checks characteristics of lead acid batteries. The readings are checked against a matrix. Matrices can be created for various applications.\nEver since Cadillac invented the starter motor in 1912, the SLI (starting, lighting and ignition) has taken on additional responsibilities. “Starting is easy, but can we steer and brake?” drivers ask. The main task of a starter battery was to crank the engine. Today, the duty is shifting towards assuring adequate energy reserve for auxiliary loads and start-stop function. Battery fades unnoticed and a periodic capacity check is vital. A battery behaves much like a horse that gallops until it drops dead.\nMost testers for starter batteries are impedance-based and only read CCA (Cold Cranking Amp). CCA governs power delivery that impacts engine cranking and is related to internal resistance. CCA stays stable with age and the readings are ill-suited as a health indicator. Capacity, on the other hand, gradually decreases and serves as a dependable performance predictor. Figure 2 illustrates CCA and capacity of 20 aging starter batteries. All batteries were functional at time of testing.\nTest Method\nCCA was taken with Spectro CA-12; capacity was measured with an Agilent load bank by applying full discharges according to BCI standards.\nFigure 2: Capacity and CCA of aging batteries. Batteries 1–9 have good CCA and high capacities; batteries 10–20 are at the end-of-life with capacity loss. All batteries crank well.\n“Is there a connection between CCA and capacity?” many wonder. To find out, Cadex examined 175 aging starter batteries and found a correlation with r2 = 0.55. Had the correlation been closer to 1, the diamond dots in Figure 3 would have gravitated towards the red reference line. This is not the case, meaning that CCA cannot be used reliably to estimate capacity or predict the end of battery life. A more in-depth assessment of the test results reveals that very few batteries fail due to low CCA; it is the low capacity that eventually pulls CCA down. Note the high number of batteries straddling the 40% capacity cut-off line. Capacity, not CCA, governs battery health and can be utilized to predict end-of-life.\nTest method\nCapacity and CCA are tested according to SAE J537\nFigure 3: Relationship between CCA and capacity on 175 starter batteries. The correlation is only 0.55. Passing starter batteries dwell in the green acceptance field bound by the 40% capacity and 50% CCA threshold.\nThe test accuracy of the Spectro CA-12 depends on battery anomaly and the quality of matrix used. A reputable test lab in Germany tested the CA-12 against a competitive impedance tester on a large number of starter batteries. Using the battery-specific matrix, the CA-12 attained correct capacity prediction of 87%; CCA was 97%. In comparison, the CCA accuracy of the impedance tester was only 51% (with no capacity reading). Service personnel may be unaware of the low accuracies impedance testers provide. As a result, many faulty batteries pass as good, only to fail on the road, while good batteries are replaced by error, causing undue expenses for customers.\nTraditional battery testers measure capacity by a discharge and the batteries must first be fully charged to get a correct reading. This is not the case with Spectro CA-12 DC, and capacity testing at partial charge is possible. If below 60% SoC, the unit advises to charge and retest. The 15-second test time does not stress the battery as a full discharge would. The instrument uses a battery-specific matrix and provides numeric readings.\nIn Cart Mode, the capacity of each monoblock is displayed numerically and graphically. The graphic display allows verifying capacity-match of all monoblocks at a glance. Matching is important for good performance and long service life; weak monoblocks can be spotted and replaced. With the ability to measure capacity on-the-fly, strong monoblocks can be regrouped for a second life.\nTroubleshooting electrical systems during fabrication, as well as transportation and showroom activities drains the vehicle battery. A battery should leave the factory with a state-of-charge of about 90%, but verifying this by voltage alone can prove inaccurate. Applying a load distorts the battery voltage, and neutralizing the effect takes up to 24 hours. Voltage based SoC measurements are inherently inaccurate.\nThe impedance integrity of a battery remains steady with load. This opens the door to measure SoC by impedance and Spectro CA-12 SoC makes use of this. The test takes 15 seconds and can be done with a parasitic load, as well as immediately after charge (but not during charge). Surface charge and voltage agitations have minimal effect on the readings. The instrument uses an application-defined matrix and displays SoC in percentage. Figure 4 shows the relationship of battery voltage and “Spectro SoC” when applying a 50A load. Note the stable Spectro SoC compared to the decreasing voltage.\nFigure 4: Voltage and Spectro™ results when loading a battery\nThe voltage shows a sharp drop when applying a 50A load (purple line). Meanwhile the “Spectro SoC” line remains steady.\nBattery manufacturers are often at a loss why some batteries have low capacity. Checking each battery on a high-volume production line is prohibitive, and yet the buyer judges quality on the lowest performing battery. The CA-12 QA makes performance checking possible by verification against a “golden sample.”\nNew batteries improve with use, but weak ones from the crib tend to have a shorter service life than the strong ones. Spectro CA-12 QA identifies underperforming batteries and prevents them from entering distribution channels. Performance testing leads to improved manufacturing practices and higher yields. Furthermore, a performance evaluation at the point of fabrication allows for the efficient sorting of batteries into different price classes. Classification and elimination of under-performing battery packs ensures consistent quality and reduces warranty returns.\nImpedance is resistance in an alternating current (AC). Resistance depends on the frequency and produces a real and an imaginary part. The impedance of a battery can be presented by the Nyquist plot in which the imaginary impedance is shown on the vertical axis and the real impedance on the horizontal axis.\nFigure 5 illustrates three batteries with different characteristics in a Nyquist plot. The scanning frequency is 20–2,000 Hertz; the upper end represents 20 Hertz and contains the most information about the battery. A healthy battery has low real ohmic resistance and gravitates to the left of the graph. As the battery ages, its spectrum moves to the right an upwards. Good batteries show straight tails and only display a small bend above the neutral line; aging ones shift to the top right and bend over.\nFigure 5: Nyquist plot of batteries with different performance\nNyquist plots can be used to compare test signatures against a “golden sample” that is taken from a battery with solid performance characteristics. Battery A in Figure 5 represents one. To prepare a golden sample, the user scans one or several good batteries with Spectro CA-12 NQ and downloads the data to PC-Companion software for display. Nyquist also assists in manufacturing and incoming inspection, as well as warranty claims through fault analysis and field service.\nThere is no ideal battery test instrument, but scientists predict that the battery industry is moving towards electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The Spectro CA-12 is one of the first battery testers using this technology outside research laboratories estimating capacity. This significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-health prediction. Cadex is working on expanding Spectro™ to include lithium-ion batteries.\nAdvanced instruments often use matrix systems but the development of a matrix can be a challenge if no naturally aged samples are available. Stress-aging batteries may be possible but this does not reflect a true life situation. The release of the generic matrix is welcome news, especially in the service sector. The generic matrix for the automotive market comes at a time when the industry recognizes the importance of capacity measurement. The same matrix can test most starter batteries.\nAdditional information on the Spectro technology can be found on the Cadex website.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-412-charging-without-wires",
        "content": "Wireless charging may one day replace plugs and wires, similar to how Bluetooth and Wi-Fi have modernized personal communication. The concept rests on inductive coupling using an electromagnetic field that transfers energy from the transmitter to the receiver.\nWireless transfer of power is not new. In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered induction by sending electromagnetic force through space. In the late 1800s and the early 1900s, Nicola Tesla demonstrated wireless broadcasting and power transmission. The experiments in Colorado Springs in 1899 lead to the Wardenclyffe Tower in New York. Tesla wanted to prove that electrical power could be transmitted without wires, but lack of funding halted the project.\nIt was not until the 1920s that public broadcasting began. Europe built massive transmitters that covered many countries. The station at Beromünster in Switzerland could have transmitted radio signals at 600kW, but legislation on electro-smog and protests from the local population limited the power to 180kW. Smaller FM stations have since replaced these large national transmitters; cellular repeaters and Wi-Fi stations transmit at a fraction of this power and many are in single watt digits.\nWireless charging shares similarities with radio transmission. It sends signals in a near field condition in which the primary coil produces a magnetic field that is picked up by the secondary coil in close proximity. The radio transmitter, on the other hand, works on the far field principle by sending waves that travel through space. While the receiving coil of the wireless charger captures most of the energy generated, the receiving antenna of the radio only needs a few microvolts (one millionth of a volt) to recover a signal that becomes intelligent when amplified.\nWireless charging is classified as inductive charging, resonance charging, and radio (RF) charging. Most of today’s wireless chargers use inductive charging at 100-300KHz with transmit and receive coils in close proximity. Electric toothbrushes were one of the first consumer goods to adopt this method.\nLarger batteries for the electric vehicle use resonance charging at 6.78MHz by making a coil “ring.” The oscillating magnetic field works within a 1-meter (3-foot) radius. To stay in the power field, the distance between transmit and receive coil must be within a quarter wavelength.\nRadio charging serves low-power devices operating within a 10-meter (30-foot) radius from the transmitter to charge batteries in medical implants, hearing aids, watches, entertainment devices and RFID (radio frequency identification) chips at 900MHz and higher. The transmitter sends a low-wattage radio wave and the receiver converts the signal to energy. Radio charging also known as RF, resembles radio transmission; it offers high flexibility but has low power and exposes people to electro-smog.\nResonance charging is not limited to high-wattage wireless chargers; it is used at all power levels. While a 3kW system for EV charging achieves a reported efficiency of 93–95 percent with a 20cm (8 inch) air gap, a 100W system is better than 90 percent efficient; however the low-power 5W system remains in the 75–80 percent efficiency range. Resonance charging is still in the experimental stages and is not widely used.\nWireless charging needed a global standard and the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) accomplished this in 2008 by introducing the Qi norm. This opened the door for device manufacturers to offer chargers for Qi-compatible devices with 5 watts of power.\nPowermat, a Qi participant, sprung loose over a disagreement and in 2012 started PMA as a new competitive norm. PMA is similar to Qi but runs at a different frequency. Also in 2012, A4WP, now known as AirFuel, announced resonance charging that allows freedom of movement while simultaneously charging several devices. Table 1 summarizes the three norms.\nQi is a magnetic standard with transmitting and receiving coils lining up; AirFuel is RF that permits lose coupling to enable charging multiple devices. Other standards are also in use.\nA war is being fought over Qi and PMA. To accommodate both systems, some manufacturers offer chargers and mobile devices that serve both standards. This is a repeat of when Columbia Records released the 33 rpm LP (Long Play) in 1948 and RCA Victor promoted the 45 rpm record featuring a large hole. Dual-speed gramophones and an insert solved the problem.\nIn 2016, SAE International released SAE TIR J2954 for the electric vehicle. Standardization enables drivers to simply park their vehicles in spaces with TIR J2954 equipment without having to take further action to initiate the charge. SAE TIR J2954 runs at a frequency of 85 kHz (81.39 – 90 kHz) and comes with Wire Power Transfer (WPT) levels 3.7kW (WPT 1) and 7.7kW (WPT 2). Future releases will include 11kW (WPT 3) and 22kW (WPT 4).\nTIR J2954 compatible systems are currently being tested with the US Department of Energy and the Argonne National Labs. Rollout with finalized standards will be in 2018.\nModern wireless charging follows a complex handshake to identify the device to be charged. When placing a device onto a charge mat, the change in capacitance or resonance senses its presence. The mat then transmits a burst signal; the qualified device awakens and responds by providing identification and signal strength status. The signal quality is often also used to improve the positioning of the receiver or enhance magnetic coupling between mat and receiver.\nThe charge mat only transmits power when a valid object is recognized, which occurs when the receiver fulfills the protocol as defined by one of the interoperability standards. During charging, the receiver sends control error signals to adjust the power level. Upon full charge or when removing the load, the mat switches to standby.\nTransmit and receive coils are shielded to obtain good coupling and to reduce stray radiation. Some charge mats use a free moving transmit coil that seeks the object placed for best coupling, others systems feature multiple transmit coils and engage those in close proximity with the object.\nWPC calls the transmitter the TX Controller, or Base Station, and the receiver on the mobile device the RX Controller, or Power Receiver. There is a resemblance to a transformer with a primary and secondary coil. Figure 2 illustrates an overview of a Qi wireless charging system.\nSeveral systems are competing that may not be compatible. The three most common are Qi, PMA, and AirFuel, formerly A4WP.\nQi logo, Chinese word meaning \"natural energy\"\nWireless charging offers the ultimate convenience for consumers and enables safe charging in a hazardous environment where an electrical spark could cause an explosion. It further permits charging where grease, dust or corrosion would prevent a good electrical contact. Eliminating electrical contacts also helps doctors in sterilizing surgical tools. Wireless charging is durable and does not wear out the contacts on multiple insertions.\nMakers of electric vehicles seek convenience in charging, and this is elegantly solved by parking the vehicle over a transmit coil. Engineers talk about embedding charging coils into highways for continuous charging while driving or when waiting at a traffic light. This is technically feasible, but high cost, low efficiency and field emission when transmitting high power remain insurmountable challenges.\nFor household and business use, the California Energy Commission (CEC), Level V, mandates that AC adapters must meet a minimum efficiency of 85 percent; Energy Star Level V requires 87 percent (European CE uses CEC as a base). Adding the losses of the AC adapter to wireless charging brings the overall efficiency down further as the inductive transfer efficiency of inductive charging is only 75–80 percent. Such a loss adds up when considering that an estimated one billion mobile phone chargers are plugged into AC outlets worldwide. To improve efficiency and comply with the Energy Star requirements, WPC combines the power needs into a single power conversion.\nLost energy turns into heat, and a wireless charger can get quite warm during charging. This causes stress on the device’s battery as it sits on the mat. It should be noted that the heat buildup only occurs during charging; the charging pad cools down once the battery is fully charged.\nWPC was very careful when releasing Qi; the first version has a maximum power of 5 watts. A medium-power version of up to 120 watts is in the works, but this norm must meet stringent radiation standards before release. Radiation prompts health concerns and these are raised by folks living next to mobile phone towers and Wi-Fi stations.\nElectromagnetic energy from radio towers, mobile phones, Wi-Fi and now wireless charging are categorized as non-ionizing radiation and are said to be harmless. Ionizing rays from x-rays, on the other hand, can cause cancer. As the number of non-ionizing devices grows, folks begin to question the safety of this form of radiation as well. Regulatory authorities are observing possible health risks and will impose restrictions if harm can be proven.\nHealth problems caused by electromagnetic waves are inconclusive; however, carrying a mobile phone close to the body is a concern. In standby mode the device is constantly seeking contact with a tower by transmitting signal busts. The transmit power is adjusted to the proximity of the tower and is higher in remote areas.\nGoing wireless demands a 25 percent cost premium on the charging station, a burden that also affects the receiver. For consumers who don’t want to pay the price, charging by wires remains a workable alternative. Birds looking for the missing wires will appreciate this move.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-402: What Is C-rate?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-402-what-is-c-rate",
        "content": "Charge and discharge rates of a battery are governed by C-rates. The capacity of a battery is commonly rated at 1C, meaning that a fully charged battery rated at 1Ah should provide 1A for one hour. The same battery discharging at 0.5C should provide 500mA for two hours, and at 2C it delivers 2A for 30 minutes. Losses at fast discharges reduce the discharge time and these losses also affect charge times.\nA C-rate of 1C is also known as a one-hour discharge; 0.5C or C/2 is a two-hour discharge and 0.2C or C/5 is a 5-hour discharge. Some high-performance batteries can be charged and discharged above 1C with moderate stress. Table 1 illustrates typical times at various C-rates.\nThe battery capacity, or the amount of energy a battery can hold, can be measured with a battery analyzer. (See BU-909: Battery Test Equipment) The analyzer discharges the battery at a calibrated current while measuring the time until the end-of-discharge voltage is reached. For lead acid, the end-of-discharge is typically 1.75V/cell, for NiCd/NiMH 1.0V/cell and for Li-ion 3.0V/cell. If a 1Ah battery provides 1A for one hour, an analyzer displaying the results in percentage of the nominal rating will show 100 percent. If the discharge lasts 30 minutes before reaching the end-of-discharge cut-off voltage, then the battery has a capacity of 50 percent. A new battery is sometimes overrated and can produce more than 100 percent capacity; others are underrated and never reach 100 percent, even after priming.\nWhen discharging a battery with a battery analyzer capable of applying different C rates, a higher C rate will produce a lower capacity reading and vice versa. By discharging the 1Ah battery at the faster 2C-rate, or 2A, the battery should ideally deliver the full capacity in 30 minutes. The sum should be the same since the identical amount of energy is dispensed over a shorter time. In reality, internal losses turn some of the energy into heat and lower the resulting capacity to about 95 percent or less. Discharging the same battery at 0.5C, or 500mA over 2 hours, will likely increase the capacity to above 100 percent.\nTo obtain a reasonably good capacity reading, manufacturers commonly rate alkaline and lead acid batteries at a very low 0.05C, or a 20-hour discharge. Even at this slow discharge rate, lead acid seldom attains a 100 percent capacity as the batteries are overrated. Manufacturers provide capacity offsets to adjust for the discrepancies if discharged at a higher C rate than specified. (See also BU-503: How to Calculate Battery Runtime) Figure 2 illustrates the discharge times of a lead acid battery at various loads expressed in C-rate.\nSmaller batteries are rated at a 1C discharge rate. Due to sluggish behavior, lead acid is rated at 0.2C (5h) and 0.05C (20h).\nWhile lead- and nickel-based batteries can be discharged at a high rate, the protection circuit prevents the Li-ion Energy Cell from discharging above 1C. The Power Cell with nickel, manganese and/or phosphate active material can tolerate discharge rates of up to 10C and the current threshold is set higher accordingly.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Removing the “black-box” stigma by making performance transparent\nBattery users imagine a battery pack being an energy storage device that resembles a fuel tank dispensing liquid fuel. For simplicity reasons, a battery can indeed be perceived as a vessel storing electrical energy; however, measuring energy flowing into an electrochemical device and then drawing it out again is far more complex than handling liquid fuel. While a hydraulic fuel gauge measures liquids moving in and out of a tank of known size, a battery fuel gauge reads units of current. Battery size is specified in ampere hours (Ah), and what makes estimating battery state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH) so challenging is an unsteady state; a battery loses capacity with each charge and leaks energy in the form of self-discharge.\nThe specified capacity of a new battery is (should be) 100%; replacement is typically at 80%. A standard fuel gauge only shows SoC; capacity is not revealed. A full charge lights up the entire SoC scale, even if the capacity has faded to 50% and delivers only half the runtime.\nEstimating battery SoC is commonly done by coulomb counting. The theory goes back 250 years when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb first established the “Coulomb Rule.” It consists of units of electric charge in which one coulomb (1C) equals one ampere (1A) for 1 second. Figure 2 illustrates the principle of in and outflowing currents representing coulomb counting.\nCoulomb counting should be flawless but tracking errors occur. If, for example, a battery was charged for 1 hour at 1 ampere, the same amount of energy should be available on discharge. No battery can do this. Inefficiencies in charge acceptance, especially towards the end of charge and particularly if fast-charged, reduces the energy efficiency. Losses also occur in storage and during discharge. The available energy is always less than what has been fed into the battery.Coulomb counting becomes part of a battery management system (BMS) that also assists in controlling mobile phone and laptop batteries. Furthermore, a BMS keeps the battery voltage and current in check to maintain safety and prolong battery life. The user of a new gadget is usually inclined to trust a fancy fuel gauge graphic. A false sense of security may develop but this trust is dashed when the runtimes get shorter with each charge as the device ages. For the casual user of a mobile phone or laptop, a fuel gauge error is only a mild irritant. The problem escalates with medical and military devices, as well as with drones and electric drivetrains that depend on precise range predictions.To maintain fuel gauge accuracy, a smart battery should periodically be calibrated by discharging it until the “Low Battery” symbol appears on the device. This can be done in the device. A full cycle sets the respective flags as shows in Figure 3. A linear line forms between these two anchor points to allow reasonably accurate SoC estimations for a time.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nHow often should a battery be calibrated? This depends on the application. A battery in continued use should be calibrated every 3 months or after 40 partial cycles. If the device applies a periodic full deep discharge, then calibration should not be needed. A user’s manual for an Apple iPad reads: “For proper reporting of SoC, be sure to go through at least one full charge/ discharge cycle per month.”What happens if the battery is not calibrated regularly? Can such a battery be used with confidence? The battery should function normally and there are no safety concerns, but the digital SoC readout becomes unreliable.When designing a BMS, engineers often make the mistake of assuming that a battery will always stay young. As with us folks, batteries age and this is manifested in capacity loss. The SoC gauge will always show a glowing 100% after each charge. Capacity is conveniently hidden from the user.Several methods to estimate battery SoH exist and are in development. This article describes five technologies. They are:\n* SMBus stands for System Management Bus and is one of the most common “smart battery systems” for portable battery applications. Other systems provide similar features.\nSome mobile phones and laptops come with software that estimates SoH. This is done by coulomb count, but service technicians familiar with such systems say that the readings are not reliable. Part of this arises from inaccuracies in measuring discharge current when running different applications. The load is pulsed and not all mobile phones allow current measurement. This prevents the use of the capacity app in such cases.\nCoulomb counting is also used to estimate the capacity of e-bikes. Although carefully monitored, the SoH readings are not revealed to the user. For reasons of anonymity, only authorized personnel have access by a security code. Device manufacturers fear that showing a capacity of less than 100% would raise too many consumer complaints, especially during the warranty period. Such secrecy typically only applies to consumer products; industrial applications differ.SoC of a portable device is usually shown in percentage or in runtime minutes; the EV does this with driving range in kilometers or miles. A true assessment in Ah, as is possible with a tank of gasoline in a vehicle is not possible with the battery. The amount of Ah a battery can capture as it ages goes into hiding. Consumer concerns aside, knowing battery capacity has the benefit of connecting Ah with runtime and predicting battery replacement on capacity, the leading battery health indicator.\nChargers are advancing and will soon offer battery SoH readouts. As industries switch to the SMBus battery, FCC (full charge capacity) stored in the battery can interpret SoH by the coulomb count taken while the battery is in service. This allows checking SoH by simply inserting the battery into a charger. The SMBus battery has a further advantage of providing a digital serial number that will enable storing historic battery performance information in a database.If the FCC reading in such a charger is above the user-set Pass/Fail threshold, then the battery will pass; if below, calibration is needed. Calibration applies a full charge and discharge cycle to reset the flags and ascertain the true capacity of the “chemical battery.” If the capacity is above target, then the battery passes and the FCC reading is corrected; results below the line calls for a battery replacement. Digital FCC peripherals are normally lower than the actual battery capacity and this prevents a false positive result. Figure 3 demonstrates the concept in graphics. Cadex is developing a charger line that encompasses this feature under the Universal Diagnostic Charger (UDC) series.\nThe UDC chargers in development will feature Read-and-charge (RAC) diagnostic technology to estimate battery capacity in the absence of FCC. A RAC-based charger requires a onetime calibration for each battery model; cycling a good battery delivers this parameter that is stored in the charger or battery adapter.The RAC charger estimates SoC and capacity of a regular (dumb) battery. Tests are showing better accuracies with RAC than what is possible with the FCC capture of an SMBus battery. RAC validates battery performance and does quality control with no extra logistics. The green “ready” light at the end of service assures that the battery is fully charged and meets the required capacity threshold. A faded battery is identified and shown the backdoor.\nThe Rapid-test takes a snapshot of a chemical battery in seconds or minutes. Electrochemical Dynamic Response uses pulse technology; the more complex Multi-model Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (Spectro™) scans the battery with multiple frequencies. Rapid-tests have the advantage of testing a broad range of batteries without smarts on the fly, but this requires complex software and hardware that is supported by battery-specific parameters and matrices.It is important to note that the capacity of a battery cannot be measured similar to voltage, current and temperature. SoH can be estimated to various degrees of accuracy based on its symptoms; however, a reliable measurement is not possible if the symptoms are vague or not present.Many makers of battery test devices promise capacity estimation by measuring the internal battery resistance. This is misleading and advertising features that are outside the equipment’s capabilities confuses the industry into believing that complex tests can be done with basic methods. Resistance-based instruments can indeed identify a dying or dead battery — so does the user. Battery testers are often overstated similar to promoting a shampoo that promises to grow lush hair on a man’s bald head.\nThis method applies a full charge/discharge cycle to read the capacity of the chemical battery. The time discharging a battery with a regulated discharge current determines the capacity. Although accurate and also serving as calibration of a smart battery, a full cycle is time consuming and is not always practical, especially when checking mobile phone batteries.\nMany device manufacturers do not provide sufficient guidelines on battery maintenance and the user is ill-informed on battery performance and when to replace a fading battery. There is a “hand-washing” when passing a device to the workforce, saying, “You are on you own — good luck with the battery.”Developing a better battery is incomplete without improving the diagnostics. Only a well-designed diagnostic system that monitors state-of-function (SoF) will turn the battery into a reliable, safe, cost efficient and environmentally sustainable power source. The modern battery will interact with system and user, state its needs, proclaim what it can deliver and establish definite limitations.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

If we take the cut-off event of the current-voltage recharge phase as a reasonable approximation of the \"fully charged\" state, and then measure the Coulombs consumed until the battery voltage drops to a given Voltage threshold, would the total Coulombs counted between these two events provide a fair estimate of the battery health? As the battery ages, the number of Coulombs between these \"fully charged\" and \"almost depleted\" states would likely decrease. Over time, I believe this measure would provide a reasonable picture of the battery health evolution.

        "content": "How to Meet Field Integrity and Airworthiness\nDuring an external pre-flight inspection before takeoff, the pilot notices heavy white smoke billowing from the cargo hold of the Boeing 737 and declared “Mayday.” Emergency crews arrived and uncovered 28 batteries in a checked transit case, 6–8 of which had been destroyed by fire. The report said that an electrical short in a battery started the fire after the passenger declared that no batteries were in the transit case. Under civil aviation laws, passengers failing to declare dangerous goods face penalties of up to 7 years in prison. Shipping lithium batteries are subject to the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act.\nLithium-ion is safe but with millions of industrial and consumer applications, failures will happen. Microscopic metal particles coming in contact with other parts in the battery cell caused the Sony recall. Battery manufacturers strive to minimize the presence of such particles; however, assembly techniques make the elimination of such dust a challenge. Modern cells with ultra-thin separators of 21µm (21-thousandth of an mm) are more susceptible to impurities than older designs with a heavier separator and lower ampere-hour (Ah). While the classic 1,350mAh in the 18650 cell could tolerate a nail penetration; the energy-dense 3,400mAh of today turns into a firework when performing the same test. The 18650 is a standardized Li-ion cell introduced in the early 1990s of 18mm in diameter and 65mm in length.There are two types of battery failures. One is a one-in-10-million incident involving a manufacturing flaw that mostly leads to a recall. The second is a rare random event alike being hit by a meteor. The reasons for such failures are hard to find as the damaged cell cannot be reconstructed. Possible causes are charging at sub-freezing temperature, high heat, excessive vibration and/or repeated heavy loading. Just talk to a hobbyist, a hover board race driver or a drone operator; they are familiar with these stresses.Most battery failures leading to disintegration start with a mild electrical short that goes unnoticed. The battery performs normally and the user is unaware of a pending breakdown. This differs from a faulty structure that shows stress marks before falling. Structural anomalies are well documented and the failure threshold is known. In this respect, the battery behaves more like a black box with a mind of its own. Organizations such as NRTL, ANSI, UL, IEEE are beginning to study battery applications and mandate correct uses. A heavy truck will receive a long-lasting engine rather than a souped-up engine from a sports car of same horsepower.Battery failures are also being caused by electrode deflection or abnormal weld spots, as was the case with the Samsung Note 7 smartphone. Fast charging at cold temperatures promotes dendrite formation, so does storing Li-ion below 1.5V/cell for more than a week. These stresses may lead to elevated self-discharge and an electrical short by building up heat spots that weakens the separator.During thermal runaway, Li-ion vents, the temperature quickly rises to 500°C (932°F), at which point the cell catches fire or explodes. This is known as “venting with flame; “rapid disassembly” is the preferred term in the battery industry. The exhausting gases are carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, as well as gases formed by the vaporizing electrolyte.\nBecause batteries can release high energies, a safety mechanism is required that prevents damage if a short is applied. The most basic device is a fuse that opens at high current. Some fuses open permanently and render the battery useless; others are more forgiving and reset. The positive thermal coefficient (PTC) is a re-settable device that creates high resistance on excess current and reverts back to normal.Further layers of safeguards are solid-state switches that disconnect the battery when current or voltage readings rise above a set threshold. Current limitations are set according to the cell’s Ah rating; voltage limitations engage when exceeding 4.3V/cell on charge and 2.2V/cell on discharge of a Li-ion cell. (Other settings may apply.) Some cells are disabled if the temperature rises to 90ºC and/or the pressure exceeds a set limit. All switching devices have a residual resistance that causes a slight increase in overall battery resistance and a decrease in maximum current flow.The protection circuit shields the battery from outside aggressions, but it is ineffective to stop an internal thermal runaway once in progress. Like a nuclear meltdown, the battery feeds on its own energy, however melting separators that are built into some advanced cells inhibiting ion flow at high temperature will slow the process down. The batteries recalled in 2006, as well as the main-ship battery in the Boeing 787 and batteries in other incidents passed all regulatory safety requirements, yet failed under normal use and with proper protection circuits in place.Batteries entering a hazardous area must be intrinsically safe. This applies to mobile phones, two-way radios, laptops, cameras, flashlights, gas detectors, medical instruments, including devices operated with primary 9V, AA and AAA cells. Regulated under IEC 60079, a circuit built into the packs or device limits the current to prevent an electrical spark from forming that could ignite gases in oil refineries or chemical plants, as well as dust at grain elevators or textile mills. Certification in North America is by Factory Mutual, UL, CSA and others; Europe is under ATEX and most accept the IEC 60079 standard.\nBuilding a Li-ion battery pack begins by estimating voltage, current and runtime requirements. Some consumer products go for a slim profile and the choice is a prismatic or pouch cell. If space allows, the 18650 provides the lowest cost and best performance in terms of specific energy, safety and durability.The early Li-ion battery was considered fragile and unsuitable for high loads. Today, lithium-based systems stand shoulder-to-shoulder with robust nickel and lead chemistries. When building a Li-ion pack, two distinct types must be reviewed.The Energy Cell is built for maximum capacity to provide long runtimes. The Panasonic NCR18650B Energy Cell in Figure 1 has a very high capacity when discharged at 0.5C (red line) but is less enduring at 2C (purple) at twice the rated current. Rather than delivering 3,200mAh to the 3V/cell end discharge line, the Energy Cell delivers only 2,300mAh (red circle); 28 percent less than specified.\nThe Panasonic UR18650RX Power Cell in Figure 2 has a moderate capacity of 1.95Ah but offers excellent load capabilities. A 10A (5C) discharge has minimal capacity loss at the 3.0V end of discharge voltage. This is ideal for applications requiring heavy load current, such as power tools. Although 40 percent less in capacity than the Energy Cell, the Power Cell also offers superior performance at cold temperatures.\nThe finished battery must undergo electrical and mechanical tests to meet the Manual of Tests and Criteria Recommendations according to UN 38.3 for the transportation of dangerous goods. These rules harmonize with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US Department of Transport (DOT) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The certification applies to primary and secondary lithium cells and batteries and must meet these requirements:\nT1 – Altitude Simulation: Low pressure simulating unpressurized cargo hold at 15,000 meters.T2 – Thermal Test: Temperature extremes by keeping batteries for 6h at -40°C and +75°C.T3 – Vibration: Test simulates vibration during transportation at 7Hz to 200Hz for up to 3 hours.T4 – Shock: Test simulates vibration during transportation at given G-forces relating to battery size.T5 – External Short Circuit: With fusing, apply a short circuit at 50°C. Case cannot exceed +170°C.T6 – Impact: >20mm cylindrical cell tested for impact; all <20mm cell types tested for crushing.T7 – Overcharge: Charge at twice the recommended current for 24 hours (secondary batteries only)T8 – Forced Discharge: Same as T7, forced discharge with primary and secondary cells.\nAuthorized laboratories performing the tests require a pool of 24 batteries consisting of 12 new samples and 12 that have been cycled 50 times. The batteries must pass the tests without causing harm of involving disassembly, rupture of fire within 6 hours of the test, but the packs may perish during testing. IATA wants to ensure that the batteries in question are airworthy and have field integrity; cycling the packs 50 times before the test adds some reality. The high certification cost of $10,000 to $20,000 discourages small manufacturers from using Li-ion for low-volume products and entrepreneurs may choose nickel-metal-hydride as this chemistry does not require the same level of testing. Obsolescence of an existing lithium cell is another issue that adds to cost. A recertification of the back is needed even if the new cells are a direct replacement. Regulators say that cell approval cannot be transferred to the pack because the safety confirmation is on a finished product and not the components.\nIf a Li-ion battery overheats, hisses or bulges, immediately move the device away from flammable materials and place it on a non-combustible surface. If at all possible, remove the battery and put it outdoors to burn out. You may also put the device outside and keep it there of a least 6 hours.A small Li-ion fire can be handled like any other combustible fire. For best result use a foam extinguisher, CO2, ABC dry chemical, powdered graphite, copper powder or soda (sodium carbonate). Halon is also used as fire suppressant.FAA instructs flight attendants to use water or soda pop to extinguish a fire in the cabin. Water-based products are most readily available and are appropriate since Li-ion contains very little lithium metal that reacts with water. Water also cools the adjacent area and prevents the fire from spreading. Research laboratories and factories use water to extinguish small Li-ion fires.A large Li-ion fire, such as an EV, may need to burn out as water is ineffective. Water with copper material can be used, but this may not be available and is costly for fire halls. When encountering a fire with a lithium-metal battery, only use a Class D fire extinguisher. Lithium-metal contains lithium that reacts with water and makes the fire worse. Only use the Class D fire extinguisher on lithium fires.\nDuring a thermal runaway, heat from the failing cell in a battery pack may propagate to the next cell, leading to thermally instability. A chain reaction can occur in which each cell disintegrates on its own timetable. A pack can thus be destroyed in a few seconds or over several hours as each cell is consumed. Packs should include dividers to protect a failing cell from spreading to the neighboring one. Mobile phones run on a single Li-ion cell whereas laptop batteries have several cells connected in series and parallel to achieve the needed voltage and Ah rating.

        "content": "When charging a battery, the charger's ready light will eventually illuminate, indicating that the battery is fully charged. The user assumes that the battery has reached its full potential and the battery is taken in confidence.\nThe 'green light' does not guarantee sufficient battery capacity or assure good state-of-health (SoH). \"Ready\" only indicates that the battery is full to whatever capacity that was available to fill. The rechargeable battery is a corrosive device that gradually loses the ability to hold a charge. Lack of periodic maintenance on nickel-based batteries hastens the capacity loss through crystalline formation, also known as memory. Lead and lithium-based batteries have other age related degradations. The capacity loss becomes apparent after one year of service. Some batteries deteriorate faster than others. Battery users are often unaware that their fleet batteries may barely last a day with minimal energy reserve to spare. Weak batteries can hide comfortably because little demand is placed on them in an ordinary day. The situation changes when full performance is required during an emergency. A collapse of portable communications is common and such breakdowns are often caused by poor battery performance.\nWeak batteries charge quicker and remain on 'ready' longer than strong ones. Bad batteries tend to gravitate to the top and become a target for the unsuspecting user. In an emergency situation when quick charging action is required, the batteries that are on 'ready' may be deadwood. In the meantime, the good packs are still charging because they have more capacity to fill. Large performance variations between the batteries will occur over time if the fleet batteries are not checked and maintained on regular schedule. Figure 2 illustrates four batteries of different sizes and state-of-health conditions. When observing the usable and unusable part of a battery, one can see that the larger packs do not necessarily carry more energy. Memory ridden batteries B and D retain less energy than the smaller battery A. Carrying larger batteries or switching to energy-dense chemistries does not improve system reliability if weak packs are left in the fleet.\nA weak battery can be compared to a fuel tank of a car that has been crushed. Refueling this tank is quick because it holds only a small amount of fuel. Like the green light on a charger, the fuel gauge will show full when the tank has been filled and everything looks normal to the driver. However, the distance traveled before refueling will be short. Batteries do not offer a fuel gauge to check the remaining energy and periodic battery maintenance is required. The benefit of such an exercise is three-fold: it identifies and eliminates non-performers, it increases battery reliability, and it prolongs the of life nickel-based batteries. Weak batteries affected by memory can often be restored to full service with battery analyzers featuring the recondition program.\nA simple, self-governing maintenance system for fleet batteries is illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5. The time required maintaining a large battery fleet should take less than 30 minutes per day. The analyzer used should be able to produce battery stick-on labels and feature a battery recondition program. A properly run battery maintenance program pays back in less than one year on prolonging battery life alone, not to mention the benefit of improved system reliability.\nRechargeable batteries do not die suddenly but gradually get weaker over time. Implementing regular battery maintenance greatly reduces unexpected downtime caused by weak batteries. Manufacturers of portable equipment stress the importance of regular battery testing and endorse the use of battery analyzers.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "AC conductance testing was introduced in 1992 as a new way of measuring the cold cranking amps (CCA) of a car battery. This non-invasive method was hailed as a major breakthrough and, to a large degree, eliminates load testing to measure battery performance. The test only takes a few seconds; the readings are displayed in digital numbers and a message spells out the condition of the battery. There are no sparks at the battery terminals and the instrument remains cool. But single frequency AC conductance has limitations. It does not measure CCA according to SAE standards but offers an approximation relating to the battery's power output capability. This relative power figure often varies with state-of-charge and other battery conditions. At times, a good battery fails and a faulty one passes by error. But the most significant drawback is its inability to read the reserve capacity (RC). Despite these shortcomings, AC conductance has become an accepted standard for predicting battery life and determining when to replace an old battery before it becomes a nuisance.\nA good battery needs high CCA and high capacity readings but these attributes reflect differently depending on the application. A high CCA reading assures good battery conductivity and provides strong cranking ability. High CCA goes hand-in-hand with a low internal battery resistance. Figure 1 compares high CCA with a large, open tap that allows unrestricted flow.\nReserve capacity governs the amount of energy the battery can store. A new battery is rated at a nominal capacity of 100%. As the battery ages, the reserve capacity drops and the battery eventually needs replacing when the reserve capacity falls below 70%. The RC reading always refers to a fully charged battery; the state-of-charge (SoC) should not affect the readings when measured with a rapid-tester.A battery may provide a good CCA reading and start a car well but be low on reserve capacity. This battery would be run down in no time when drawing auxiliary power. Figure 2 illustrates such a battery. The so-called 'rock content' that builds up as the battery ages is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nFigure 3 illustrates a battery with good reserve capacity but low CCA. This battery has a difficult task turning the starter and needs replacing even though it could be used for low load applications.\nWith increased demand for auxiliary power on vehicles, measuring energy reserve is more relevant than CCA. The slogan goes: \"Starting is easy… but can I steer and brake?\" Modern battery testers must adapt to this new requirement and also include RC measurement. European car manufacturers place heavy emphasis on reserve capacity, while in North America CCA is still the accepted standard to assess battery performance. Most modern battery testers also provide state-of-charge readings (SoC). Measuring reserve capacity is more complex than CCA. Many methods have been tried, including multi-frequency conductance, but most have limitations. One of the main obstacles is processing large volumes of data received when scanning a battery with multiple frequencies. Collecting the data is easy; making practical use of the information is the problem. The cost of high-speed microprocessors and processing difficulties has put the price tag on such battery testers out of range. Put changes are coming.Cadex Electronics has developed a method that enables the processing of a large volume of data received through multi-model electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Trademarked Spectro™, the system injects 24 excitation frequencies ranging from 20 to 2000 Hertz. The signals are regulated at 10mV to remain within the thermal battery voltage of lead acid. This permits stable readings for small and large batteries. The test takes 20 seconds, during which about 40 million transactions are completed. Normally, EIS requires dedicated equipment and a computer to analyze the obtained data. To permit such analyses in a hand held unit, high-speed digital signal processing is used. In 2005, the Spectro™ invention received a patent (US patent 6,778,913, Jörn Tinnemeyer). Spectro™ has primarily been demonstrated on 12V lead-acid batteries, automotive in particular. The large pool of available car batteries provides an excellent platform to verify the technology. The same technology can also be used on nickel and lithium-based batteries. On the strength of our invention, Cadex has developed a battery rapid-tester (CA-12) for automotive batteries. One of the strongest features of Spectro™ is its ability to reveal CCA, reserve capacity and state-of-charge on a single measurement. Displaying RC has been on the wish list of battery manufacturers and service centers for many years. In fact, this will be the first time such information can be obtained non-invasively with a commercial hand-held tester. Figure 4 shows the suggested display format.\nThe battery needs to be charged for testing. The typical test band is 50% to 100% SoC. Early tests provide stable results over a wide temperature range. There is good immunity to electrical noise. Parasitic loads of up to 30A have been tried without notable side effects. Furthermore, Spectro™ appears to be less sensitive to surface charge than single frequency AC conductance and the CCA readings are more consistent. The tester tolerates some acid stratification but chemical additives may affect the readings. Figure 5 illustrates the CA-12 tester.\nVerifying the accuracy and repeatability of a new invention takes much time and effort. To test Spectro™, Cadex assembled a test bed of 91 car batteries with diverse performance levels. The preparation consisted of a fully saturated charge, followed by a 24-hour rest period and a 25A discharge to 10.50V (1.75V/cell), during which the reserve capacity was measured. This procedure produced an astonishing +/-15% variation in capacity readings across the full population. When comparing the capacity obtained through a conventional discharge and by non-invasive means, one must take into account the vulnerability of lead acid in producing varied readings even when using highly accurate charges and load banks.Figure 6 compares the reserve capacities of 38 randomly chosen car batteries. The black diamonds show the reserve capacity derived through a full discharge; the purple squares represent Spectro™ estimations using a generic matrix.\nHow can the RC readings be further improved? Best results are achieved by sorting the batteries according to architecture and CCA rating. We developed a model specific matrix and tested a group of same-model batteries. Figure 7 shows the reserve capacity readings derived through a conventional full discharge and Spectro™. With specific matrices, the readings approach laboratory standards in terms of accuracy.\nAlthough the test results in Figure 6, and in particular Figure 7, look very encouraging, we need to be reminded that Spectro™ is not a universal battery tester capable of measuring any battery that comes along. It cannot be compared to a photocopier that duplicates any document or flat object by simply pressing the copy button. Rather, Spectro™ needs a battery specific matrix as a reference. To a large extent, the quality of the matrix governs the accuracy. The matrices are stored in the tester and need selecting together with the Ah and/or CCA rating. We are currently making gains in establishing generic matrices that may be used for CCA and RC measurements.Price is another issue. Because of added complexity and higher parts count compared to single frequency AC conductance, the Spectro™ technology will command a higher price. We are not competing directly with currently available battery testers; rather, we offer a solution for those needing a better technology because the present method may be insufficient.\nTechnology has advanced to a point where measuring battery performance through non-invasive means will become the acceptable standard. Applying a full discharge for the purpose of obtaining the reserve capacity is impractical and stresses the battery. Multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with improved data processing algorithms will bring this task one step closer to reality.Multi-frequencies EIS not only makes RC estimations possible; it also improves the CCA readings. Rather than providing a reference numbers relating to battery conductivity, EIS can give actual CCA equivalents. The technology also improves state-of-charge estimations. Typical applications include verifications of battery warranty returns, assessing the state-of-life of stationary batteries and checking the capacity for batteries in defense and marine applications. EIS is also an indispensable tool in examining batteries for wheelchair, golf carts, robots, boats and forklifts.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "NOTE: This article has been archived. Please read our new \"Cost of Power\" for an updated version.\nLifting off in a large airplane is always exhilarating. At a full weight of almost 400 tons, the Boeing 747 requires 90 megawatts of power to get airborne. Takeoff is the most demanding part of the journey, and when the plane reaches cruising altitude the power consumption decreases to half.\nPowerful engines were used also when the mighty Queen Mary was launched in 1934. The 81,000-ton ocean liner measuring 300 meters (1,000ft) in length was propelled by four steam turbines producing a total power of 160,000hp (120 megawatts). While in service, the ship carried 3,000 souls and traveled at a speed of 28.5 knots (52km/h). The Queen Mary is now retired in Long Beach, California.\nLarge propulsion systems are only practical with internal combustion engines, and fossil fuel serves as a cheap and readily available power source. Low energy-to-weight ratio in terms of net calorific value (NCV), as well as a relatively short life span, makes batteries unsuitable beyond a given application. While fossil fuel delivers a NCV of 12,000Wh/kg, a manganese type lithium-ion battery offers 120Wh/kg, which is one hundred times less per weight. Even at a low efficiency of 25 percent, the internal combustion engine outperforms the best battery in terms of energy-to-weight ratio. The capacity of a battery would need to increase twenty-fold before it could compete head-to-head with fossil fuel.\nAnother limitation of battery propulsion over fossil fuel is the fuel by weight. While the weight diminishes as it is being consumed, the battery has the same deadweight whether fully charged or empty. This puts limitations on EV driving distance and would make the electric airplane impractical. Furthermore, the combustion engine delivers full power at freezing temperatures and continues to perform well with advancing age, a trait that is not achievable with the battery. A battery that is a few years old may deliver only half of the rated capacity.\nEnergy from non-rechargeable batteries is most expensive in terms of cost per kilowatt-hours (kWh). Primary batteries are used for low-power applications such as wristwatches, remote controls, electric keys and children’s toys. Military in combat, light beacons and remote repeater stations also use primaries because charging is not practical. Table 1 estimates the storage capability and cost per kWh of primary batteries.\nAAA Cell\nAA Cell\nC Cell\nD Cell\n9 Volt\nCapacity (alkaline)\n1,100mAh\n2,500mAh\n7,000mAh\n14,000mAh\n600mAh\nEnergy (single cell)\n1.4Wh\n3Wh\n9Wh\n18Wh\n4.2Wh\nCost per cell (US$)\n$1.25\n$1.00\n$1.60\n$1.60\n$3.10\nCost per kWh (US$)\n$890\n$330\n$180\n$90\n$730\nTable 1: Energy and cost comparison of primary alkaline cells. Energy from primary batteries is most expensive; cost increases with smaller battery sizes.\nImproved runtimes, lower unit price and the convenience of recharging have shifted many portable applications previously reserved for primary batteries to rechargeable batteries. Table 2 compares the cost of power with rechargeable batteries. The cost is based on battery price and the number of possible discharge/charge cycles. The analysis does not include electricity for charging or the cost of purchasing and maintaining charging equipment.

Older technologies have lower cost/kWh than newer systems; larger cells are most cost-effective. The costs are commercial packs at estimated over-the-counter prices.\n* Cycle life is based on battery receiving maintenance.\nWith dwindling fossil fuel supply, governments and the private sector are studying alternate energies. Table 3 compares the cost to generate 1kW of power by taking into account the initial investment, adding the consumption of fuel and including the eventual replacement of the system. Power from the electrical utility grid is most cost-effective; consumers in industrialized countries pay between $0.05 and $0.25US per kWh. (The typical daily energy consumption per household is 25kW.) Gasoline (and equivalent) is the most economical portable fuel.\nFuel type\nEquipmentto generate 1kW\nLife span\nCost of fuelper kWh\nTotal costper kWh\nLi-ionfor vehicular use\n$1,000/kW(based on 10kW battery at $10,000)\n2,500h (replacement cost $0.40/kW)\n$0.10\n$0.50(replacement and $0,10/kWh)\nGasoline engine for vehicular use\n$30/kW(based on IC engineat $3,000/100kW)\n4,000h(replacement cost $0.01/kW)\n$0.33\n$0.34\nFuel cell- portable use- mobile use- stationary use\n$3,000 – 7,500\n2,000h4,000h40,000h\n$0.35 -> -> ->\n$1.85 – 4.10$1.10 – 2.25$0.45 – 0.55\nElectricityelectric grid\nAll inclusive\nAll inclusive\n$0.10\n$0.10\nTable 3: Cost of generating 1kW of energyThe table includes the initial investment, fuel consumption, maintenance and eventual replacement of the equipment. The figures are estimates at the time of writing.\nThe fuel cell is most effective in converting fuel to electricity, but high equipment cost makes this power source expensive in terms of cost per kWh. In virtually all applications, power from the fuel cell is considerably more expensive than from conventional methods.\nWe now look at the energy that our bodies consume. An active man requires 3,500 calories per day to stay fit, which relates to roughly 4,000 watts in a 24-hour day (1 food calorie = 1.16 watt-hour). Traveling on foot covers about 40km (25 miles) per day and a bicycle increases the distance by a factor of four to 160km (100 miles). Eating two potatoes and a sausage for lunch can propel a bicyclist for the entire afternoon, covering 40km (25 miles), as I have experienced myself. The human body is amazingly efficient in converting food to energy.\nTable 4 compares the energy per passenger/kilometer for a loaded Boeing 747, the retired Queen Mary ocean liner, a gas-guzzling SUV, a fit person on a bicycle, and a person walking on foot.

In terms of high-speed transportation, air travel consumes theleast amount of energy per passenger-km. The boat is efficient for slow and heavy freight. The absolute lowest energy consumption is the bicycle.\n* 1 joule is the energy of 1A at 1V for 1 second, or 1 watt/s, or 0.238 calorie/s; 4.186 joules raise the temperature of 1g of water by 1°Celsius; 1,000 joules are 0.277Wh.\nBicycles are by far the most effective form of transportation. Comparing the energy consumption of a bicycle to that of a car, a cyclist would consume only 0.4 liter of fuel per 100km (630mpg). Walking is also efficient; it uses about one liter per 100km (228mpg). The problem with self-powered propulsion is the limited travel range before fatigue sets in.\nIn terms of energy usage, cars are one of the least efficient modes of transportation. The internal combustion engine utilizes only 25 percent of the net calorific value from the fuel for propulsion. The calculation looks even worse when taking into account the weight of the vehicle with a single passenger, the driver. The ratio of machine to man is typically ten-to-one. When accelerating a 1.5-ton vehicle, less than two percent of the energy moves the 75kg (165lb) driver, his briefcase and the lunch bag; 98 percent goes to heat and friction. Even a modern jet plane has better fuel efficiency than a car. A fully occupied Airbus 340 gets 3.4l/100km (70mpg), cruising at 950km/h (594mph).\nTrains are one of the most efficient modes of transportation. The 36km Yamanote circle line connecting major urban centers in Tokyo carries 3.5 million passengers per day. During rush hour, the 11-car train runs every 150 seconds. Such a passenger volume would be unthinkable by private cars on city streets. Trains are also economical to move freight. Transporting one ton of freight consumes only 0.65 liters of fuel per 100km (362mpg).\nAffluent societies want personal transportation, but with a large critical mass driving vehicles on government-funded highways with minimal contribution by the drivers and without mandated limits, this free-roaming lifestyle is taking a toll on our energy resources. Developing countries also desire personal transportation. As car become affordable to them, they will begin consuming fossil fuel too and this will increase the need for hydrocarbons further. According to the US Department of Energy, 71 percent of the oil consumed in the USA is for transportation. Out of this, 51 percent goes to passenger cars and light trucks. Smaller vehicles and the development of efficient rail systems could cut the energy for transportation in half. Read more about Free energy... Almost!\nGovernments are exploring ways to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel and to lower emissions. They do this by promoting the electric car. This is done in good faith, but looking at Figure 5 we may be facing an impossible task. Many readers will agree that the success of personal transportation was only made possible with the abundance of oil at very low price in terms of net calorific value. The notion of driving a large vehicle for long distances may not be transferable with battery propulsion, even with government subsidies. Today’s batteries are weak contenders against petroleum, and the chart below demonstrates this. Li-ion, the battery choice for the electric vehicle, is hardly visible; the 90 percent efficiency of the electric motor does not make up for the low net calorific value.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-704-how-to-transport-batteries",
        "content": "Unresolved airplane crashes that were likely caused by batteries catching fire onboard during flight include the Asiana Airlines 747 near South Korea in July 2011, a UPS 747 in Dubai, UAE in September 2010 and a UPS DC-8 in Philadelphia, PA in February 2006. These events prompted changes to the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria in how batteries are certified for transport under UN 38.3.\nSafety prompted authorities to tighten the rules when transporting batteries. Although lithium batteries get the most attention, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says that based on records from 1991 to 2007 it was only a factor in 27 percent of all incidents. Lead acid, NiMH, NiCd and alkaline are also to blame. Reports say that short circuit, a preventable problem that can be solved with better packaging, is the largest problem. Figure 1 shows unprotected cells that can cause an electrical short by touching; propagation can create a chain reaction releasing a large amount of energy.\nMuch blame goes to faulty. Regulatory authorities recommend putting small batteries into clear plastic bags and placing them in a firm box with good padding. Limit the content per box.\nSome wet, non-spillable sealed lead-acid batteries grouped under UN 2800 are exempt from Class 8. The battery manufacturer must declare how a battery is regulated on its associated Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and most AGM (absorbent glass mat) batteries can be shipped under the simpler UN 2800 directive. MSDS contains information on the potential health effects of exposure to chemicals or dangerous substances and on safe workplace procedures when handling chemical products.\nDifferent rules apply when shipping damaged batteries. A lead acid battery is considered damaged if the possibility of leakage exists due to a crack or if one or more caps are missing. Transportation companies and air carriers may require draining the batteries of all acid prior to transport. Place damaged batteries in an acid-resistant container and add soda ash to neutralize any acid that might spill. Separate damaged and intact batteries.\nNickel-based batteries have no transport limitations; however, some of the same precautions apply as for lead acid in terms of packaging to prevent electrical shorts and safeguard against fire. Regulations prohibit storing and transporting smaller battery packs in a metal box. If there is a danger of an electrical short, wrap each battery individually in a plastic bag. Do not mix batteries with coins and house keys in your pocket.\nThe largest changes in shipping directive are with lithium batteries, and with good reasons. Li-ion is the fastest growing battery chemistry and already in 2009, 3.3 billion Li-ion were transported by air. Safety is an ongoing concern, and an airline-pilot association asked the FAA to ban lithium batteries on passenger aircraft. This came into effect in 2016 and lithium batteries are now shipped in cargo airplanes only.\nLithium batteries can only be transported after passing UN 38.3 testing requirements. In spite of these precautions, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recorded 138 airport and air incidents between 1991 and 2016 involving lithium batteries. They involved smoke, heat and fire related to battery-operated devices such as e-cigarettes, laptops and mobile phones. Some incidents occurred before takeoff and the batteries were removed from the aircraft. Battery fires in flight were extinguished with halon type fire extinguishers and water, by placing the damaged device in a thermal battery containment bag that some airlines carry. Failing batteries in the cargo hold that were inadvertently checked into luggage required emergency landings.\nNot all incidents are reported to the FAA, but the number of reported incidents is up from 2015. Recorded failures in 2016 alone involved 13 e-cigarettes, four laptops, seven mobile phones/tablets and seven spare batteries. E-cigarette incidents increased notably, while mobile phone and laptop events remain moderate considering the number of such devices in use.\nSince 2008, lithium batteries can no longer be placed in checked baggage; they must be carried onboard. Air travelers are reminded of how many batteries they can carry with a portable device and as spares. Quick access to a fire extinguisher enables putting out a fire in the cabin should one take off. A coffee pot served as the fire extinguishing device for a flaming laptop battery in one reported incident. This is not possible with a burning battery in the cargo hold.\nTransported lithium-based batteries are divided into two types: The rechargeable lithium-ion is primarily found in mobile phones and laptops; the non-rechargeable lithium-metal with added restrictions because of its high lithium content is used in sensing devices as well as in some consumer grade AA, AAA and 9V formats. Airlines allow both types as carry-on, either installed in devices or carried as spare packs as long as they don’t exceed the following limitation of lithium or equivalent content:\nThe lithium content of a lithium-metal battery is printed on the label. Li-ion, on the other hand, uses equivalent lithium content (ELC) that is calculated by multiplying the rated capacity (Ah) times 0.3. For example, a 1Ah cell has 0.3 grams of lithium. A modern 18650 cell with a capacity of 3.3Ah contains about 1 gram. The 8-gram limit permits a 26Ah battery, or 95Wh (Ah multiplied by the Li-ion cell voltage of 3.6V equals Wh). The 18650 is a standardized Li-ion cell of 18mm in diameter and 65mm in length, and is used in laptops, power tools and other devices. Most laptop batteries are in the 60Wh range.\nWhile regulations limit the Li-ion battery to no larger than 100Wh, each passenger is allowed to carry two spare packs of 160Wh each, not exceeding 320Wh in total. The airlines recommend placing each battery in a clear plastic bag to prevent electric short. Batteries that are contained (non-removable) within a device and are not easily removable are exempt from the rules. These include electric watches, smartphones and laptops but not power tools with interchangeable battery packs. (See BU-704a: Shipping Lithium-based Batteries by Air)\nAll lithium batteries are considered to be dangerous goods and transporting them requires compliance with Class 9 directives. However, exemptions are made when shipping these batteries in small quantities. Personnel transporting lithium batteries commercially must be trained. Organizations such as iHazmat or the International Compliance Center (ICC) educates shippers and packers in the handling of dangerous goods consistent with to International Air Transport Association (IATA) requirements and issues a certificate of compliance to those participants who pass a written examination. Those not familiar with these restrictions often ask some of the following questions:\nSince 2016, lithium batteries can no longer be carried in passenger aircraft as cargo. Transporting them are organized by Packaging Instructions (PI) numbers. The most common designations include:\nEach PI is further divided into Sections representing IA, IB and II (Roman numerals). IA is most stringent, and for simplicity this article lists the less restricted packaging first:\nSee also Dangerous Goods Documentation, entitled “2017 Lithium Battery Guidance Document.”\nShippers and passengers must be aware that batteries are not the only dangerous good banned on an aircraft as cargo or in checked luggage. Travelers often put the safety of other passengers in danger by checking in or bringing on board banned items. Figure 4 illustrates some of these forbidden goods. The Australian Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) remind travelers to declare potentially dangerous goods. Check dangerous goods under CASA if uncertain what is allowed.\nMishaps remind travelers of the importance to observe safety bylaws. In 2014, the captain of a Boeing 737 aircraft declared “Mayday” after observing heavy white smoke billowing from the cargo hold of the plane during an external pre-flight inspection. Emergency crew uncovered 28 batteries in a checked transit case, 6–8 of which had been destroyed by fire. The report said that an electrical short in a battery started the fire after the passenger declared that no batteries were in the transit case. Under civil aviation laws, passengers failing to declare dangerous goods face penalties of up to 7 years in prison. Figure 5 illustrates the remains of the charred content.\nRegulations are only as good as actual adherence to the rules. Shipment of dangerous goods can be circumvented by deliberately mislabeling batteries. There are reported cases where Li-ion was marked with NiCd, a chemistry that is not classified as dangerous goods. In other cases, lithium-metal with strictest requirements was listed as more benign Li-ion. Battery chemistries are difficult to identify and the offense may go undetected. Tightening rules only makes sense if they can be administered policed with reasonable ease; imposing rules that are too stringent will invite lawbreakers. Only purchase lithium batteries that come from a reputable company. Check that the batteries meet the UN Manual of Test and Criteria requirements.\nAvoid storing and transporting small batteries in a metal box. Do not carry batteries with coins and house keys in your jeans. Batteries can short circuit and release high amounts of energy, especially lithium systems. While a household alkaline may get hot when shorted, lead acid will draw high current for a few seconds, heat up and possibly spill. Lithium-ion is most treacherous especially when fully charged. An unprotected Li-ion cell or battery pack continues to draw high current that can lead to a violent self-destruction and injury through heat exposure and venting with flame.\nUp-to-date information on Shipping Lithium Batteries by Air is available on 2021 Lithium Battery Guidance Document.\nDisclaimer: While every effort was made to ensure that the information contained in this publication is accurate, the publisher of Battery University does not warrant or guarantee accuracy and completeness; nor does the publisher take responsibility for errors, omissions or damages that may arise from this information.

        "content": "Consumer products have benefited the most from the advancements in battery technology. The size and weight reductions achieved for the high-end cell phones, PDA's and laptops have not trickled down to batteries for wheeled and stationary applications in an expected fashion. Only marginal improvements have been gained on larger batteries. One of the reasons for the apparent lack in progress is the loyalty to the classic sealed lead-acid battery. The wheeled and stationary industries have several reasons for their unwillingness to change: [1] lead-acid is mature and inexpensive. [2] The low energy density is no major drawback because the battery is either on wheels or is stationary. [3] The limited cycle life can, to some extent, be compensated by using larger batteries. Unlike portable devices, most wheeled and stationary batteries are replaced due to age rather than wear out effect induced by high cycle count.\nWheelchairs and scooters are almost exclusively powered by sealed lead-acid batteries. Regular car batteries are sometimes used for cost reasons. There is, however, a danger of spillage if overturned. Neither are regular car batteries designed for deep cycling. The demanding cycling regiments of wheelchairs and scooters cause an undue strain on these batteries and shorten their lives. nickel-based batteries would be lighter than lead-acid but are more expensive and maintenance prone. Lithium-ion would simply be too delicate, not to mention the high cost. A new generation of wheelchair is being developed that is able to 'stand up' and climb stairs. These high-tech devices use gyroscopes for balancing. To obtain the extra power needed to run its internal computer and electric motors without adding too much weight, nickel-based batteries are used. The two-wheeled Segway scooter being touted to solve city transportations problems also uses nickel-based batteries.\nAnyone serious about the electric bicycle would use nickel-based batteries. Sealed lead-acid is simply too heavy and does not provide the cycle count needed to satisfy daily use. In addition, lead-acid requires a long charge time of 10 hours and more. Lithium-ion would simply be too expensive and delicate. The lack of a suitable battery that is light, durable and inexpensive is, in my opinion, delaying the public acceptance of the electric bicycle.\nThe electric vehicle will gain public acceptance as soon as a battery emerges that is inexpensive and provides 10 years of reliable service. The high cost and limited cycle life of the batteries used in hybrid vehicles negate the savings achieved in burning less fuel. The benefits are more environmental in nature rather than in cost savings. Higher fuel prices could change this equilibrium. nickel and lithium-based batteries have been tried but both chemistries have problems with durability and stability. lithium-ion has an advantage in weight but this gain is offset by a high price. Similarly, nickel-metal-hydride used for the hybrid vehicle is expensive and requires forced air-cooling. No battery manufacturer is willing to commit to a 10-year warranty. After excursions into new battery chemistries, design engineers always come back to the old but proven lead-acid.The fuel cell may still be two decades away before offering a viable alternative for cars. An executive from Ford stated recently that the fuel cell may never be feasible to replace the internal combustion engine. Cost and longevity remain major drawbacks.Since the invention in 1839 by Sir William Grove, the advancements in the fuel cell have been slow. Much attention was then placed on improving the internal combustion engine. It was not until the Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s that the fuel cell was used to provide power and water in space. During the 1990s, renewed activities took place and the fuel cell stocks soared. Unlike the rapid developments in microelectronics, which generated income in its early stages, fuel cell research continues to depend on government grants and public investors. It is our hope that one day the fuel cell will become a viable option to the polluting combustion engine.\nUntil the mid 1970s, most stationary batteries were flooded lead-acid. The Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) allowed batteries to be installed in smaller confinements because the cells could be stacked and mounted in any position. Although VRLA are less durable than flooded lead-acid, simple mounting and lower cost make them the preferred battery system for small and medium sized installations. Most UPS systems repeater stations for cell phones use VRLA. Large installations, such as internet hubs, hospitals, banks and airports still use the flooded lead-acid. Heat is the main killer of batteries. Many outdoor installations for communication systems lack proper venting, not to mention air conditioning. Instead of the expected 10-year service life, the batteries need replacement after 2 to 5 years. Many batteries in the field are in such bad conditions that they could only provide power for a short time, should a major power outage occur. Stationary batteries are often installed and forgotten.A Canadian manufacturer of lithium-polymer batteries is taking advantage of the heat problem. They offer lithium-polymer for standby applications, a battery that needs heat to operate. The dry lithium-polymer lacks conductivity at ambient temperature and must be heated. The battery includes heating elements to keep its core temperature at 60°C (140°F). The mains provide the energy for heating. On a power outage, the battery must also provide power for heating the core. To conserve energy, the battery is well insulated. Unlike the VRLA, the high ambient heat does not shorten the lithium-polymer battery. The high cost remains a drawback and only a few lithium-polymer batteries are used for stationary applications today.Flooded nickel-cadmium batteries have been used for many years in applications that must endure hot and cold temperatures. This battery system is substantially more expensive that Lead-acid but the improved longevity makes up for the higher investment cost. The flooded nickel-cadmium batteries are non-sintered and do not suffer from memory. It should be noted that only the sintered sealed nickel-cadmium cells are affected by memory and need regular discharges.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Battery users and entrepreneurs often ask, “Can batteries be restored?” The answer is: “It depends.” A battery failure does not always mean end of battery life. Rather than discarding a pack, ingenious entrepreneurs are discovering business models to grant retired batteries a second life. Considering the growing number of batteries that are being discarded, such business opportunities can only grow.\nThe three main battery defects are low capacity, high internal resistance and elevated self-discharge. Capacity fade occurs naturally with use and time; resistance increase is common with nickel-based batteries; and elevated self-discharge reflects possible stresses endured in the field. Capacity loss can often be reversed with NiCd and NiMH; lead acid with sulfation can sometimes also be improved(See BU-901: Fundamentals in Battery Testing)\nBattery defects include low capacity, high internal resistance and elevated self-discharge. Capacity fade occurs naturally with use and time; resistance increase is common with nickel-based batteries; and elevated self-discharge reflects stress. Capacity loss can be reversed on nickel-based batteries affected by memory; some lead acid with sulfation can also be improved.\nBatteries can be classified into portable, wheeled mobility, starter and stationary systems. Not all batteries are worth servicing but there are jewels among the rubbish. To turn a profit, some basic battery knowledge will be needed, such as familiarity with chemistries and understanding voltage, Ah, charge methods and C-rate. Above all, you must have a knack to spot what to touch and what to pass. Knowing the former life and how the end of battery life is determined will play a large role in how well these discarded batteries can be redeployed.\nStore clerks replace mobile phone batteries on the slightest customer complaint without testing the pack. Installing a new battery satisfies the customer but this often does not solve the perceived problem of short runtime and the customer may return. There are also batteries that go to sleep due to over-discharge. These seemingly dead lithium-ion packs cannot be recharged with a regular charger but there is a way to boost them back to life(See BU-808a, How to Awaken Sleeping Li-ion)\nMany mobile phone batteries are discarded. They fill large boxes under service counters with nowhere to go. Meanwhile, service providers have discovered that nine out of ten replaced packs are good and can be restored. A recent study estimates the cost of frivolous battery replacement to be over $650 million per year in the USA alone.\nIngenious entrepreneurs have discovered an opportunity to recirculate these abandoned batteries. Service centers have sprung up in the USA, UK and Israel that purchase surplus batteries by the ton and check them with battery analyzers capable of performing rapid-testing(See BU-907: Testing Lithium-based Batteries) Some service centers handle as many as 400,000 batteries per month and the refurbished packs are redistributed as B-grade to stores. Studies show that these B-grade batteries perform as well as a new pack as there is no reported difference in the failure rate.\nNot all smartphones allow battery replacement, but this does not eliminate the need to test them. Not being able to replace the batteries has affected the business model as there are fewer available packs to test and recirculate.\nUnder-usage is more common in healthcare than over-usage, and this leads to discarding a large pool of good batteries. A manager of the Energy Storage Research Program at DOE visited a recycling plant in the USA and discovered that “every year roughly one million usable lithium-ion batteries are sent in for recycling with most having a capacity of up to 80 percent.” A medical technician in a large USA hospital in Michigan reuses spent batteries from patient heart pumps to cut the grass at home with his electric lawn mower. This makes green energy even greener.\nBiomedical technicians are aware of frivolous battery replacements and a whistle-blower at a mid-sized US hospital said: “Batteries are the most abused components in hospitals. Staff care little about them and only do the bare minimum. Recommendations for battery maintenance are vague and hidden deep inside service manuals.”\nRestoring spent batteries lends itself to several business models. One is collecting and testing batteries from organizations that would otherwise discard them. The in-house analysis includes checking the capacity by applying a full discharge/charge cycle with suitable battery test equipment. Capacity is the leading health indicator and should read between 80 and 100 percent. Lower thresholds may be acceptable for less critical applications.\nWhen testing a battery pack, also observe the internal resistance. The resistance of lead- and lithium-based batteries stays low until the end of life. Although an ohmic reading cannot predict the capacity, a high measurement could indicate anomalies such as corrosion, also known as parasitic reactions on the electrolyte and electrodes.\nBattery validation should also include a self-discharge test by observing the voltage loss of a fully charged battery over 24 hours or longer. A stable voltage assures that the cell or pack had not been unduly stressed. A voltage difference of +/-5mV per cell after 24 hours is a go. If all requirements are met, the battery can be recertified and sold at reduced cost.\nA smart battery may also fail by the manufacturer deliberately programming the end-of-life based on battery usage or age. This can be a fixed cycle count, a calendar date or exceeding the Max Error level on an SMBus pack. A further cause of failure is the inability to communicate due to a digital fault. Such errors cannot be corrected digitally but the cells may still be good. Salvage involves cracking the pack open and utilizing the naked cells.\nThe cells can be checked individually or left intact as a family by observing capacity, internal resistance and self-discharge. When building a pack, pay attention to cell matching. Only use cells of the same model number and equal performance to build a pack. It is not recommended to utilize cells that were designated for single-cell use for multi-cell packs as the performance may vary(See BU-910: How to Repair a Battery Pack)\nBatteries made for the electric powertrain are designed to last longer than those in consumer products. Experts predict that these rugged industrial batteries should still have up to 70 percent capacity after 10 years of service or 160,000km (100,000 miles) of driving on electric propulsion(See BU-1002: Electric Powertrain, HEV, PHEV) If such a long life can be expected, then it will make sense to test and re-purpose the batteries for a less demanding application. Several companies, including GM and ABB, are taking advantage of this business opportunity.\nLarge-scale batteries are divided into smaller modules that are connected in series and parallel. These units do not need cell-level checking but must meet state-of-health requirements as a module that includes capacity, internal resistance and self-discharge. Modules with similar performance levels can then be grouped together and used for solar and other systems(See BU-901: Difficulties with Testing Batteries)\nAlso known as starter, lighting, ignition (SLI), these batteries are commonly checked with a load test or a device that reads CCA (cold cranking amp). A battery that cranks can be sold for money, but a CCA measurement alone does not reveal the capacity, the leading health indicator. CCA refers to the internal resistance that stays low through most of the battery’s life while capacity gradually fades with use and time. A battery that is only tested with CCA is a gamble; adding capacity measurement commands a higher resale value(See BU-904: How to Measure Capacity)\nStationary batteries are mostly lead acid. There is no easy way to test the capacity other than applying a full discharge/charge. These batteries are commonly replaced after 5–10 years of service; more frequently in hot climates(See BU-806a: How Heat and Loading affect Battery Life) Battery failures tend to be permanent, but sulfation–related failures can be corrected if caught in time. Sulfation often occurs on a solar system when the battery never receives a fully saturated charge. This is also common on electric wheelchairs that may only get an 8-hour charge overnight.\nAdding additives to fix a faded lead acid battery is often not worth the effort. The active materials of an old battery are exhausted and the plates are corroded(More on BU-804a: Corrosion, Shedding and Internal short) Guys who claim success in restoring these old-timers echo what Thomas Edison said: “Just as soon as a man gets working on the secondary battery, it brings out his latent capacity for lying.” As with all products, the importance of reducing waste is in respecting the battery, caring for them, and only discarding them after their useful life has been spent and no salvage is possible.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries",
        "content": "Battery research is focusing on lithium chemistries so much that one could imagine that the battery future lies solely in lithium. There are good reasons to be optimistic as lithium-ion is, in many ways, superior to other chemistries. Applications are growing and are encroaching into markets that previously were solidly held by lead acid, such as standby and load leveling. Many satellites are also powered by Li-ion.\nLithium-ion has not yet fully matured and is still improving. Notable advancements have been made in longevity and safety while the capacity is increasing incrementally. Today, Li-ion meets the expectations of most consumer devices but applications for the EV need further development before this power source will become the accepted norm. BU-104c: The Octagon Battery – What makes a Battery a Battery, describes the stringent requirements a battery must meet.\nAs battery care-giver, you have choices in how to prolong battery life. Each battery system has unique needs in terms of charging speed, depth of discharge, loading and exposure to adverse temperature. Check what causes capacity loss, how does rising internal resistance affect performance, what does elevated self-discharge do and how low can a battery be discharged? You may also be interested in the fundamentals of battery testing.\nThe lithium-ion battery works on ion movement between the positive and negative electrodes. In theory such a mechanism should work forever, but cycling, elevated temperature and aging decrease the performance over time. Manufacturers take a conservative approach and specify the life of Li-ion in most consumer products as being between 300 and 500 discharge/charge cycles.\nIn 2020, small wearable batteries deliver about 300 cycles whereas modern smartphones have a cycle life requirement is 800 cycles and more. The largest advancements are made in EV batteries with talk about the one-million-mile battery representing 5,000 cycles.\nEvaluating battery life on counting cycles is not conclusive because a discharge may vary in depth and there are no clearly defined standards of what constitutes a cycle(See BU-501: Basics About Discharging). In lieu of cycle count, some device manufacturers suggest battery replacement on a date stamp, but this method does not take usage into account. A battery may fail within the allotted time due to heavy use or unfavorable temperature conditions; however, most packs last considerably longer than what the stamp indicates.\nThe performance of a battery is measured in capacity, a leading health indicator. Internal resistance and self-discharge also play roles, but these are less significant in predicting the end of battery life with modern Li-ion.\nFigure 1 illustrates the capacity drop of 11 Li-polymer batteries that have been cycled at a Cadex laboratory. The 1,500mAh pouch cells for mobile phones were first charged at a current of 1,500mA (1C) to 4.20V/cell and then allowed to saturate to 0.05C (75mA) as part of the full charge saturation. The batteries were then discharged at 1,500mA to 3.0V/cell, and the cycle was repeated. The expected capacity loss of Li-ion batteries was uniform over the delivered 250 cycles and the batteries performed as expected.\nEleven new Li-ion were tested on a Cadex C7400 battery analyzer. All packs started at a capacity of 88–94% and decreased to 73–84% after 250 full discharge cycles. The 1500mAh pouch packs are used in mobile phones.\nAlthough a battery should deliver 100 percent capacity during the first year of service, it is common to see lower than specified capacities, and shelf life may contribute to this loss. In addition, manufacturers tend to overrate their batteries, knowing that very few users will do spot-checks and complain if low. Not having to match single cells in mobile phones and tablets, as is required in multi-cell packs, opens the floodgates for a much broader performance acceptance. Cells with lower capacities may slip through cracks without the consumer knowing.\nSimilar to a mechanical device that wears out faster with heavy use, the depth of discharge (DoD) determines the cycle count of the battery. The smaller the discharge (low DoD), the longer the battery will last. If at all possible, avoid full discharges and charge the battery more often between uses. Partial discharge on Li-ion is fine. There is no memory and the battery does not need periodic full discharge cycles to prolong life. The exception may be a periodic calibration of the fuel gauge on a smart battery or intelligent device(See BU-603: How to Calibrate a “Smart” Battery)\nThe following tables indicate stress related capacity losses on cobalt-based lithium-ion. The voltages of lithium iron phosphate and lithium titanate are lower and do not apply to the voltage references given.\nTable 2 estimates the number of discharge/charge cycles Li-ion can deliver at various DoD levels before the battery capacity drops to 70 percent. DoD constitutes a full charge followed by a discharge to the indicated state-of-charge (SoC) level in the table.\n* 100% DoD is a full cycle; 10% is very brief. Cycling in mid-state-of-charge would have best longevity.\nLithium-ion suffers from stress when exposed to heat, so does keeping a cell at a high charge voltage. A battery dwelling above 30°C (86°F) is considered elevated temperature and for most Li-ion a voltage above 4.10V/cell is deemed as high voltage. Exposing the battery to high temperature and dwelling in a full state-of-charge for an extended time can be more stressful than cycling. Table 3 demonstrates capacity loss as a function of temperature and SoC.\nMost Li-ions charge to 4.20V/cell, and every reduction in peak charge voltage of 0.10V/cell is said to double the cycle life. For example, a lithium-ion cell charged to 4.20V/cell typically delivers 300–500 cycles. If charged to only 4.10V/cell, the life can be prolonged to 600–1,000 cycles; 4.0V/cell should deliver 1,200–2,000 and 3.90V/cell should provide 2,400–4,000 cycles.\nOn the negative side, a lower peak charge voltage reduces the capacity the battery stores. As a simple guideline, every 70mV reduction in charge voltage lowers the overall capacity by 10 percent. Applying the peak charge voltage on a subsequent charge will restore the full capacity.\nIn terms of longevity, the optimal charge voltage is 3.92V/cell. Battery experts believe that this threshold eliminates all voltage-related stresses; going lower may not gain further benefits but induce other symptoms(See BU-808b: What causes Li-ion to die?) Table 4 summarizes the capacity as a function of charge levels. (All values are estimated; Energy Cells with higher voltage thresholds may deviate.)\nEvery 0.10V drop below 4.20V/cell doubles the cycle but holds less capacity. Raising the voltage above 4.20V/cell would shorten the life. The readings reflect regular Li-ion charging to 4.20V/cell.\nGuideline: Every 70mV drop in charge voltage lowers the usable capacity by about 10%.Note: Partial charging negates the benefit of Li-ion in terms of high specific energy.\n* Similar life cycles apply for batteries with different voltage levels on full charge.** Based on a new battery with 100% capacity when charged to the full voltage.\nExperiment: Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, reports that using a reduced charge level of 50% SOC increases the lifetime expectancy of the vehicle Li-ion battery by 44–130%.\nMost chargers for mobile phones, laptops, tablets and digital cameras charge Li-ion to 4.20V/cell. This allows maximum capacity, because the consumer wants nothing less than optimal runtime. Industry, on the other hand, is more concerned about longevity and may choose lower voltage thresholds. Satellites and electric vehicles are such examples.\nFor safety reasons, many lithium-ions cannot exceed 4.20V/cell. (Some NMC are the exception.) While a higher voltage boosts capacity, exceeding the voltage shortens service life and compromises safety. Figure 5 demonstrates cycle count as a function of charge voltage. At 4.35V, the cycle count of a regular Li-ion is cut in half.\nBesides selecting the best-suited voltage thresholds for a given application, a regular Li-ion should not remain at the high-voltage ceiling of 4.20V/cell for an extended time. The Li-ion charger turns off the charge current and the battery voltage reverts to a more natural level. This is like relaxing the muscles after a strenuous exercise(See BU-409: Charging Lithium-ion)\nFigure 6 illustrates dynamic stress tests (DST) reflecting capacity loss when cycling Li-ion at various charge and discharge bandwidths. The largest capacity loss occurs when discharging a fully charged Li-ion to 25 percent SoC (black); the loss would be higher if fully discharged. Cycling between 85 and 25 percent (green) provides a longer service life than charging to 100 percent and discharging to 50 percent (dark blue). The smallest capacity loss is attained by charging Li-ion to 75 percent and discharging to 65 percent. This, however, does not fully utilize the battery. High voltages and exposure to elevated temperature is said to degrade the battery quicker than cycling under normal condition. (Nissan Leaf case)\n* Discrepancies exist between Table 2 and Figure 6 on cycle count. No clear explanations are available other than assuming differences in battery quality and test methods. Variances between low-cost consumer and durable industrial grades may also play a role. Capacity retention will decline more rapidly at elevated temperatures than at 20ºC.\nOnly a full cycle provides the specified energy of a battery. With a modern Energy Cell, this is about 250Wh/kg, but the cycle life will be compromised. All being linear, the life-prolonging mid-range of 85-25 percent reduces the energy to 60 percent and this equates to moderating the specific energy density from 250Wh/kg to 150Wh/kg. Mobile phones are consumer goods that utilize the full energy of a battery. Industrial devices, such as the EV, typically limit the charge to 85% and discharge to 25%, or 60 percent energy usability, to prolong battery life(See Why Mobile Phone Batteries do not last as long as an EV Battery)\nIncreasing the cycle depth also raises the internal resistance of the Li-ion cell. Figure 7 illustrates a sharp rise at a cycle depth of 61 percent measured with the DC resistance method(See also BU-802a: How does Rising Internal Resistance affect Performance?) The resistance increase is permanent.\nNote: DC method delivers different internal resistance readings than with the AC method (green frame). For best results, use the DC method to calculate loading.\nFigure 8 extrapolates the data from Figure 6 to expand the predicted cycle life of Li-ion by using an extrapolation program that assumes linear decay of battery capacity with progressive cycling. If this were true, then a Li-ion battery cycled within 75%–25% SoC (blue) would fade to 74% capacity after 14,000 cycles. If this battery were charged to 85% with same depth-of-discharge (green), the capacity would drop to 64% at 14,000 cycles, and with a 100% charge with same DoD (black), the capacity would drop to 48%. For unknown reasons, real-life expectancy tends to be lower than in simulated modeling(See BU-208: Cycling Performance)\nLi-ion batteries are charged to three different SoC levels and the cycle life modelled. Limiting the charge range prolongs battery life but decreases energy delivered. This reflects in increased weight and higher initial cost.\nBattery manufacturers often specify the cycle life of a battery with an 80 DoD. This is practical because batteries should retain some reserve before charge under normal use(See BU-501: Basics about Discharging, “What Constitutes a Discharge Cycle”) The cycle count on DST (dynamic stress test) differs with battery type, charge time, loading protocol and operating temperature. Lab tests often get numbers that are not attainable in the field.\nEnvironmental conditions, not cycling alone, govern the longevity of lithium-ion batteries. The worst situation is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures. Battery packs do not die suddenly, but the runtime gradually shortens as the capacity fades.\nLower charge voltages prolong battery life and electric vehicles and satellites take advantage of this. Similar provisions could also be made for consumer devices, but these are seldom offered; planned obsolescence takes care of this.\nA laptop battery could be prolonged by lowering the charge voltage when connected to the AC grid. To make this feature user-friendly, a device should feature a “Long Life” mode that keeps the battery at 4.05V/cell and offers a SoC of about 80 percent. One hour before traveling, the user requests the “Full Capacity” mode to bring the charge to 4.20V/cell.\nThe question is asked, “Should I disconnect my laptop from the power grid when not in use?” Under normal circumstances this should not be necessary because charging stops when the Li-ion battery is full. A topping charge is only applied when the battery voltage drops to a certain level. Most users do not remove the AC power, and this practice is safe.\nModern laptops run cooler than older models and reported fires are fewer. Always keep the airflow unobstructed when running electric devices with air-cooling on a bed or pillow. A cool laptop extends battery life and safeguards the internal components. Energy Cells, which most consumer products have, should be charged at 1C or less. Avoid so-called ultra-fast chargers that claim to fully charge Li-ion in less than one hour.\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex[2] Source: Choi et al. (2002)[3] B. Xu, A. Oudalov, A. Ulbig, G. Andersson and D.

So I wont have a balanced pack over the time... My main concern is to have a long life cycle battery. I ll use Sanyo NCR18650GA fin a 10.5ah 36V pack. I know of Smart BMS that can set balancing voltage, but they are expensive and I heard their bluetooth consume extra battery. Thanks ahead for your help\nAfter charging my lithium battery , would it be beneficial to store the battery in the refrigerator at 4 c ?\nAfter charging my lithium battery , would it be beneficial to store the battery in the refrigerator at 4 c ?\nI have two queries:\n1.) In Table 2, where you have shown Discharge cycles against a DoD. Does this 'discharge cycle' in each row denote the same complete 1 Cycle(100% amount discharged and charged, not necessarily in one go) as we understand in battery terminology. Does this one 'discharge cycle' imply the same amount for all the rows in the table. Or does it derive its meaning from the respective DoD. For e.g. does each discharge cycle at 80% DoD mean the same '100% Discharge/Charge Cycle' as what is there for 60% DoD? If not, then one discharge cycle at 80% DoD would quantify for 80 units of charging/discharging and one discharge cycle at 60% DoD would mean 60 units.\nThis would mean that 400 Discharge Cycles at 80% DoD, would have delivered 400*80 = 32000 Units. 600 Discharge cycles at 60% DoD would deliver 600*60 = 36000 Units. And both, as the table suggested, would be left with 70% Capacity.Still pretty good, even if discharge cycle mean different amount of cycle for two different DoD %. \nBut if 'discharge cycle' mean the same amount, then it would be even more compelling. 400*100 = 40000 units vs 600*100= 60000 units delivered with 70% Capacity remaining.\n2.) Similarly,Figure 6 should be interpreted wrt context.\nConsider two extremes cycles: \n 75–65% - Black Line\n100–25% - Orange Line\nAfter, 400 DST cycles of 100-25% cycle it would have delivered 30000 Units(75*400) and would be left with ~92%(from the figure) capacity. For 75–65% cycle, it would have to complete 3000 DST cycles to deliver same amount of units (10*3000) and it would be left with ~95% capacity. So, 75-65% is actually 3% better than 100-25% when both have gone through same amount of discharging/charging units. No two cycles should be compared for retention capacity on the same vertical line of DST cycles since by that time they have gone through amounts of charge/discharge units.  Still, I think as mentioned in my previous point, even for the same amount of units delivered, narrow charge-discharge bandwidth would leave you with more capacity.\nFigure 6 is informative, but there is not enough information (at least on this page) to conclude how exactly low voltage affects battery cycles as opposed to high voltage. Does charging from 0-75% have the same effect as 25%-100%? What about 0-85% compared to 15-100%?\nIt is stated in several places that fully discharging is bad for a battery, but is it really? Or is it a myth, given how damaging charging to 100% SoC is?\nAlex, Accubattery analyzed figure 6 and found that 75-65% wears 17.5% in 1000 cycles, 75-45% 8.8% and 75-25% 6.5% so that means the depth of discharge does not wear , it's ok to use up to 0%.  link:https://accubattery.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016286793-Re-Modeling-of-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Degradation-for-Cell-Life-Assessment\nThe thing is, the smaller the SoC, the high the cycles. I have an always on tablet. I did some testing and my results conclude the SoC has very little effect on capacity retention given this relationship:\nSOC\t\t\t\t25-85\t25-75\t45-75\t65-75\nHours for SoC Cycle \n(including charging)\t24\t\t20\t\t8\t\t4\nCycles (1Y)\t\t\t365\t\t438\t\t1095\t2190\nCycles (5Y)\t\t\t1825\t2190\t5475\t10950\nCycles (10Y)\t\t\t3650\t4380\t10950\t21900\n% Retention 5 Years\t~91\t\t~91\t\t~89\t\t~87\n% Retention 10 Years\t~87\t\t~88\t\t~86\t\t~84\nAccording to SOK battery tech support, this information does not apply to their LiFePo4 batteries or that chemistry in general.  Biggest issue would be lack of top balancing unless you have external balancer.  I'll still check around to see what can make these last longer.  Their recommendation was to lower the usable capacity on the bottom end to extend lifetime (increased charge cycles but lower usable capacity).\nI found that the best percentage for mobile and laptop is 0-50%.  I've been doing this for over a year on my cell phone and the battery is at 95% health, and my cell phone is almost 4 years old.\nAt first glance, the 75-65 cycle seems to be the best for the battery, but you need to normalize it for work done: a 50% depth of discharge cycle does 5 times more work, 1000 cycles of 10% is 100 full cycles. This is labeled as work done in the table below.\nSoD / EoD: start and end of discharge.\nDoD: depth of discharge, SoD - EoD.\nCap % at 4k: capacity lost at 4000 DST cycles.\nWork done: 4000 * DoD / 100%.\nCap loss per 1k work done: capacity loss per 1000 full cycles. 1000 cycles is about the full life time of a phone, about 3 years of 1 full charge a day.\nSoD\tEoD\tDoD\t                     \n        \t                   Cap loss  Work done\t                                                 \n                 Cap % at 4k        Cap loss per 1k work\n100\t25\t75\t81.5\t18.5\t3000\t6.2\n100\t40\t60\t83.5\t16.5\t2400\t6.9\n85\t25\t60\t85\t         15\t        2400       6.3\n100\t50\t50\t85.5\t14.5\t2000\t7.3\n75\t25\t50\t87\t         13           2000       6.5\n75\t45\t30\t89.5\t10.5\t1200\t8.8\n75\t65\t10\t93\t          7             400       17.5\nAs you can see, in this model, the loss is with the 100-25 cycle, or alternatively, the 75-25 cycle. It is unfortunate this information is so hidden in this paper.\nAlso, note that this test was done with a 3.3V nominal voltage cell, which is not a standard Li-ion cell, that chemistry is 3.7/3.8V, so findings do not always transfer.\nAdrian, Table 3 and Figure 6 allow you to make a rough calculation and I would say that cycling between 75-45% (approx. ~10% degradation per annum) is better than storing your battery at 100% (~20% degradation per annum). At room temperature (20C) you should expect 80-85% capacity after one year stored at 100% (Table 3). Meanwhile, cycling between 75-45%, let's say you would utilise four cycles per day (30% x 4 = 120% total battery capacity), five days per week, 48 weeks per year. This works out to 960 cycles which would leave you with ~96% capacity remaining (Figure 6). Furthermore, assuming you store the laptop overnight at ~40%, it will lose an additional ~5% capacity (Table 3).\nI can find a lot of information sure. But I can't find anything for BMS amp for each battery. Do you batterys use a BMS?\nLike many people I normally use a laptop in places with a power outlet.  To keep to a 75% to 45% use cycle as recommended, I can run a battery monitor that tells me when to disconnect and reconnect the charger.  Is there, in existence or technically possible, a way to set the laptop to stop charging the battery at a lower voltage, so that I can leave the charger connected?\nAlso, if the charger effectively disconnects the battery at 100% and the laptop runs direct from the charger, surely when leaving the charger connected all the time will not affect the battery, which will stay cool, though at 100%.  NO discharge cycles, but maintained at 100%.  Is this worse than cycling between 75% and 45%?\nCan someone please confirm for me I have a 52 V E bike battery lithium ion 19.2 AH, Correct me if I’m wrong I think this is telling me to only charge it to 75-80% full and then run it down to about 25% of discharge for maximum battery life is this correct? and I should always let the battery cool off in my home before I plug it into charge correct?\nI am trying to understand this report to clarify.\nI have a 60V 12AH lithium battery\nShould l charge it to full charge all the time.\nis the 75%-25% cycle number indicative of full cycles? or just 50% use cycles? as if the latter it can't be compared to 100-25% as that is a 75% use cycle.\nCorrect me if I am wrong, The closer you keep the battery to 50% charge the better. Also the lower the temperature the better (but not below freezing ofc).\nContext: I'm working on a project that uses an 18650 cell as battery backup to power a small processor, where line power is available almost all the time; running off the batteries would be the exception.  \nRequest: Since battery backup systems don't follow the typical charge/discharge pattern, it would be great to see an article specifically focused \"best practices for battery backup applications\".\nThank you for this article.\nA topping charge is only applied when the battery voltage drops to a certain level. !!\nwhat is certain level ?\ncan i change it ?\naccubattery analyzed the graph from this page https://accubattery.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016286793-Re-Modeling-of-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Degradation-for-Cell-Life-Assessment\nA device with Lithium batteries (especially Li-ion & Li-Polymer/LiPo) should not be left connected to chargers for >1 month unattended. Some cheaper chargers are less safe eg. ebikes, escooter, boards & toys. Some devices/chargers stipulate a maximum time for having the charger connected (ofcourse the charger is powered while connected). Notebooks have better battery chargers but you should check atleast monthly for any warping or overheating once you notice the capacity is <60% of original.\nLiFePO4 are safer for upto 70°C instead of 60°C, & piercing doesn't cause fire. The cells with nominal >3.6V & charged to >4.1V (as I 1st mentioned above) are all dangerous when pierced & more sensitive to heat.\nGrx\nIn figure 6 on this page if you look closely you will see that the discharge depth does not wear out, case 1: 75-65% uses 10% and only provides 90,000 units of power and case 2: 75-25% uses 50% and gives 150,000 power units showing that 75-25% is better than 75-65%, in the old comments Reza says just that.\nThese are other sources that show that discharging the battery to 0% is good\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002JPS...111..130C/abstract\nhttps://accubattery.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016286793-Re-Modeling-of-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Degradation-for-Cell-Life-Assessment\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=cycle%20life%20testing%20and%20modeling%20of%20graphitescience%20direct&tbm=isch&hl=pt-BR&tbs=rimg:CdBUKNSIrHK4YYsBXih3_11bRsgIMCgIIABAAOgQIABAA&client=ms-android-samsung-gj-rev1&prmd=niv&sa=X&ved=0CBIQuIIBahcKEwiw2MC-nZf3AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBQ&biw=412&bih=806#imgrc=4_37iTEG2y_zXM\nAlexandre Ramos\nI looked at the source you quoted.  According to the information I read under Modeling of Lithium-Ion Battery Degradation, there is nothing there to support that discharging a lithium battery down to 0% has benefit.  In fact, if you look at the information the conclusion you would draw is that discharging the battery down that low would have a negative effect on the life of the battery.   \nThe figures clearly indicate that a battery charged to 75% then discharged to 45% has less capacity degradation over time than a battery charged to 75% and discharged to 25%.  Why would you think discharging it all the way down to 0% would be a good idea??   For a device that is not constantly needed because a lot of the time it is in standby and the user is worried more about longevity than use 75% to 25% seems the best equation to use.  But it certainly isn't the Best Use for everyone because you end up getting less work out of the battery.\nCharging to higher amounts than 75% isn't necessarily a terrible idea if the device is going to be used immediately in such a way that the voltage wouldn't stay there long enough to do damage (leaving it charged).  For instance, I might charge up my drill to 90% because I'm getting ready to heavily use it.  It would be at 90% for so little time it wouldn't make a huge difference, outside the fact that it might allow me to stop using it at 25% instead of a lower percentage.\nPlease point me to any sources which indicate it's a good idea to completely discharge a lithium battery.  The only battery chemistry I have ever heard of that this was a good idea for was NICAD.  And that was a periodic complete drain, not habitual.\nAbout the ebike battery.  You bought this item to use, so use it.  Batteries like that can be rebuilt and considering that it costs $1000, likely much cheaper than a new would cost and worthwhile to investigate.  I do this for my drill batteries and you may want to do the same- if you're storing the bike keep the state of charge at like 75% or less.  Charge it up to 90%+ when you are going to use it.  The level of discharge is more of a function of use than a real choice you make.  I try to charge my drill batteries before they run out, hopefully by around 25% but it's use and we can't really control that.\nAfter 3 years of researching how to extend lithium battery, I found that the depth of discharge is a myth, it has zero effect on life, you can discharge up to 2.75 volts without wear and tear, a smartphone turns off when it is at 3.5 volts. what wears out is charging at high voltages. every 0.10 volts doubles the cycles, if charging up to 4.20 volts it lasts 500 cycles, 4.10v 1000 cycles and so on, on this site it doesn't show how many cycles it's 3.8 volts, but a guy tested it and it's 8000 cycles , 3.9 volts is 4000, and 3.7v is 16000 cycles! You can test it now, start discharging the battery to 0%, you will notice a significant improvement in your performance. I've been using it down to 0% for 6 months now and the battery health hasn't dropped at all and my phone is 2 and a half years old. source:https://accubattery.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/212988989-Re-Battery-University-article-BU-808 https://www.powerstream.com/lithium-ion-charge-voltage.htm\nI have a laptop with Lion battery, I like to work with it while charging and I discovered that charging it through its usb-c port is very slow. My question is; may I charge it lets say for periods of 8hours while I work?(including that room temperature is relatively low and the battery level does not reach 100% nor 0%) should I let it discharge sometime?\nThis sentence from \"What can the user do\" seems incongruous The question is asked, “Should I disconnect my laptop from the power grid when not in use?” Under normal circumstances this should not be necessary because charging stops when the Li-ion battery is full. A topping charge is only applied when the battery voltage drops to a certain level. Most users do not remove the AC power, and this practice is safe\".   Perhaps its presumed that all previous advice has been digested and the sentence is only about safety.   My reading thus far indicates that the ideal likely for battery life is to not charge it beyond 50% and re-charge it at around 25%.\nAfter 3 years how to extend the initial research battery7, finding that the depth of life, you can discharge up to 2, and for you to have an idea, a smartphone turned off. when it is at 3.5 volts. that wears out is carrying at high loads o. every 0.10 volts doubles the cycles, if charging to 4.20 volts it lasts 500 cycles, 4.10v 1000 cycles and so on, on this site it doesn't show how many cycles are 3.8 volts, but a guy tested it and 8000 cycles, double 3.9 volts is 4000 and 3.7v 16000 cycles!

I just bought an ebike that has a huge battery that I would like to preserve (It costs over $1000 dollars to replace). I like to go on long rides (big depth of discharge), But that is of course not good for the battery. I also like the increase of power when it is at a high charge however that is also not good for the battery. Both of these things are bad for the battery and shorten the amount of cycles it can endure. So the question of \"how high should I charge it, and how low should it go\" arises. From my research there is no good answer to this question as there are always trade offs.\nI have a new cordless lithium battery operated vacuum cleaner at my winter residence. Should I leave it plugged in or not for the 6 months I am away? Thank you.\nMuito bom\nInteresting site\n\"On the negative side, a lower peak charge voltage reduces the capacity the battery stores. As a simple guideline, every 70mV reduction in charge voltage lowers the overall capacity by 10 percent. Applying the peak charge voltage on a subsequent charge will restore the full capacity.\"\nSo this means that I can charge my battery on 3.92v to improve it's life but if I want the full capacity of my battery at any given moment I can go back and charge with a 4.2v charger? Thanks\nMy phone battery very fast down\nWho is the autor of this?\nIn reference to the \"long life mode\" above (stop charging at 80% while on AC power): some software solutions introduce a \"sailing mode\" that stops charging at 80%, then lets the battery discharge a bit to say 60%, then resume charging back to 80% and so on. This is supposedly to prevent frequent micro-level discharging - charging - discharging - charging etc. between say 79.9% and 80%. This is surely happening with devices that have a power circuit where - even when on AC - the device runs on battery power (cannot draw power from the charger directly to operate - the battery is always in the middle) such as modern MacBooks.\nSo my question is: is this \"sailing mode\" beneficial to the battery? Or is the frequent micro-charging around 80% not an issue for \"battery-in-the-middle\" devices?\nThanks, Peter\nComments from the previous website are not compatible with our new commenting system but we have preserved them so our users can still reference and make use the information in them.\nThe material on Battery University is based on the indispensable new 4th edition of \"Batteries in a Portable World - A Handbook on Rechargeable Batteries for Non-Engineers\" which is available for order through Amazon.com.\nBuy On Amazon"

Battery banks are also designed to provide extra power during high-traffic periods when the AC power supply does not have sufficient capacity to feed the system. In this case, the battery acts as a buffer similar to the battery in a hybrid car that assists in acceleration.\nCellular repeater towers are an example where the backup battery serves as a buffer. The batteries get fully charged during off-peak periods and go into discharge mode to assist the AC power supply during the peak times.\nWhen relying on the battery as buffer, make certain that the battery has enough time to charge between peak periods.

When reserves get low, pressing the Amazon button fetches a new bag to keep the dog happy.\nIf this simplicity is possible with dog food, replacing faded batteries in industry requires equal ease and attention.\nA new generation of charger is available that checks the capacity of a smart battery with calls for service or replacement when the Minimum Operational Reserve Energy (MORE) can no longer be met. The MORE levels in the charger are adjustable to get a ‘sweet-spot’ between reliability and economics, a feature made possible with the Target Selector. The Universal Supervisor Charger (USC) by Cadex offers these features in standalone mode and by connecting to a host that enables Cloud Analytics.\nWhen inserting a smart battery into the USC, the charger validates the available capacity with a green SoH Light as shown as in Figure 2; amber calls for calibration or replacement. Battery performance is evaluated by reading the Leftover Charge before charge. An analogy is an aircraft carrying enough fuel for a safe landing. Low Leftover Charge indicates capacity fade with need to calibrate of replace.\nLeftover Charger at the end of a day should be 10–20%. Increasing the target adds more capacity; plenty of reserve permits lower settings to keep a battery in service longer. This feature enables full use of each battery with call for replacement before failure.\nConnecting the USC to a host forms the Battery Endurance Plan (BE- Plan) as shown in Figure 3. The charger serves as ‘Amazon button’ to identify batteries in need of replacement, carried out by automated supply chain functions.\nOne of the special features is checking the smart battery at user-level on the charger. A lit green gives a pass, but an orange SoH Light calls for the calibration of the battery, done in the charger or by placing the pack in the Service Box for service in a battery analyzer. Packs that recover are returned; failing packs are replaced or assigned to lower duties.\nCloud Analytics displays fleet batteries as illustrated in Figure 5 revealing Leftover Charge, Energy Consumed and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in years. The Target Capacity setting plays a critical role in the life expectancy of a battery, information that is essential for risk management.\nThe Battery Endurance Plan with Cloud Analytics requires familiarity with MORE to establish the base on which Leftover Charge is calculated, adjustable by the Target Selector. This assures that all batteries in the arsenal meet the required capacity level, made visible to the fleet supervisor by Cloud Analytics.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-306-what-is-the-function-of-the-separator",
        "content": "The building blocks of a battery are the cathode and anode, and these two electrodes are isolated by a separator. The separator is moistened with electrolyte and forms a catalyst that promotes the movement of ions from cathode to anode on charge and in reverse on discharge. Ions are atoms that have lost or gained electrons and have become electrically charged. Although ions pass freely between the electrodes, the separator is an isolator with no electrical conductivity.\nThe small amount of current that may pass through the separator is self-discharge and this is present in all batteries to varying degrees. Self-discharge eventually depletes the charge of a battery during prolonged storage. Figure 1 illustrates the building block of a lithium-ion cell with the separator and ion flow between the electrodes.\nBattery separators provide a barrier between the anode (negative) and the cathode (positive) while enabling the exchange of lithium ions from one side to the other.\nEarly batteries were flooded, including lead acid and nickel-cadmium. With the development of the sealed nickel-cadmium in 1947 and the maintenance-free lead acid in the 1970s, the electrolyte is absorbed into a porous separator that is compressed against the electrodes to achieve chemical reaction. The tightly wound or stacked separator/electrode arrangement forms a solid mechanical unit that offers similar performance to the flooded type but is smaller and can be installed in any orientation without leakage. The gases created during charge are absorbed and there is no water loss if venting can be prevented.\nEarly separators were made of rubber, glass fiber mat, cellulose and polyethylene plastic. Wood was the original choice but it deteriorated in the electrolyte. Nickel-based batteries use separators of porous polyolefin films, nylon or cellophane. The absorbed glass mat (AGM) in the sealed lead acid version uses a glass fiber mat as a separator that is soaked in sulfuric acid.\nThe earlier gelled lead acid developed in the 1970s converts the liquid electrolyte into a semi-stiff paste by mixing the sulfuric acid with a silica-gelling agent. Gel and AGM batteries have slight differences in performance; gel batteries are commonly used in UPS and AGM in starter and deep-cycle applications. (See BU-201: How does the Lead Acid Battery Work?)\nCommercially available Li-ion cells use polyolefin as a separator. This material has excellent mechanical properties, good chemical stability and is low-cost. A polyolefin is a class of polymer that is produced from olefin by polymerizing olefin ethylene. Ethylene comes from a petrochemical source; polyolefin is made from polyethylene, polypropylene or laminates of both materials.\nThe Li-ion separator must be permeable and the pore size ranges from 30 to 100nm. (Nm stands for nano-meter, 10-9, which is one millionth of a millimeter or about 10 atoms thick.) The recommended porosity is 30–50 percent. This holds enough liquid electrolyte and enables the pores to close should the cell overheat.\nOn excessive heat, a shut-down occurs by closing the pores of the Li-ion separator through a melting process. The polyethylene (PE) separator melts when the core reaches 130°C (266°F). This stops the transport of ions, effectively shutting the cell down. Without this provision, heat in the failing cell could rise to the thermal runaway threshold and vent with flame. This internal safety fuse also helps pass the stringent UN Transportation Testing for Lithium Batteries\nthat includes altitude simulation, as well as thermal, vibration, shock, external short circuit, impact, overcharge and forced discharge tests. (See BU-304a: Safety Concerns with Li-ion.)\nMost batteries for mobile phones and tablets have a single polyethylene separator. Since ca. 2000, larger industrial batteries deploy a trilayered separator that provides enhanced fuse protection on thermal extremes and on multi-cell configurations. Figure 2 illustrates the PP/PE/PP trilayer separator consisting of polyethylene in the middle that is sandwiched by outer polypropylene (PP) layers. While the inner PE layer shuts down at 130°C by closing the pores, the outer PP layers stay solid and do not melt until reaching 155°C (311°F).\nCombining separator material with different melting properties adds to safety. PE melts before PP to close the pores and stop current flow.\nIn ca. 2008, further improvements were made by adding a ceramic-coated separator. Ceramic particles do not melt and this addition provides a further safety level. Ceramic coating is also used on lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cells that charge up to 4.40V/cell instead of the traditional 4.20V/cell. The ceramic coating works in tandem with the PE and PP layers and is placed next to the positive side to prevent electrical contact.\nThe separator should be as thin as possible so as to not add dead volume and still provide sufficient tensile strength to prevent stretching during the winding process and offer good stability throughout life. The pores must be uniformly spread on the sheet to ensure even distribution throughout the entire separator area. Furthermore, the separator must be compatible with the electrolyte and allow easy wetting. Dry areas can create hot spots through elevated resistance, leading to cell failure.\nSeparators are getting thinner. A thickness of 25.4μm (1.0 mil) is common but some go down to 20μm, 16μm and now even 12μm without significantly compromising the properties of the cell. (One micron, also known as µm, is one millionth of a meter.) The separator with electrolyte in modern Li-ion only makes up 3 percent of the cell content.\nUltrathin separators raise safety concerns. The massive Sony call-back comes to mind in which a one-in-200,000 cell-breakdown triggered an almost six million recall of Li-ion packs. On rare occasions, microscopic metal particles came into contact with other parts of the battery cell, which led to an electrical short circuit. The Sony cells in question had a separator thickness of between 20µm and 25µm. (A micrometer (µm) is one-thousands of a millimeter.) Some separators are as thin as 10 µm. Micro-shorts on separators examined in forensic labs measure about a millimeter in diameter. A well-designed separator melts at the point of shorting and provides a local shutdown.\n[1] Source: CELGARD, LLC\n[2] Source: Dalhousie, Handbook of Batteries\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-802b-what-does-elevated-self-discharge-do",
        "content": "All batteries are affected by self-discharge. Self-discharge is not a manufacturing defect but a battery characteristic; although poor fabrication practices and improper handling can increase the problem. Self-discharge is permanent and cannot be reversed. Figure 1 illustrates self-discharge in the form of leaking fluid.\nThe amount of electrical self-discharge varies with battery type and chemistry. Primary cells such as lithium-metal and alkaline retain the stored energy best, and can be kept in storage for several years. Among rechargeable batteries, lead acid has one of the lowest self-discharge rates and loses only about 5 percent per month. With usage and age, however, the flooded lead acid builds up sludge in the sediment trap, which causes a soft short when this semi-conductive substance reaches the plates(See BU-804a: Corrosion, shedding and Internal Short)\nThe energy loss is asymptotical, meaning that the self-discharge is highest right after charge and then tapers off. Nickel-based batteries lose 10–15 percent of their capacity in the first 24 hours after charge, then 10–15 percent per month. Figure 2 shows the typical loss of a nickel-based battery while in storage.\nNiMH and NiCd belong to rechargeable batteries that have the highest self-discharge; they need recharging before use when placed on a shelf for a few weeks. High-performance NiCd has a higher self-discharge than the standard versions. Furthermore, the self-discharge increases with use and age, of which crystalline formation (memory) is a contributing factor. Regular full discharge cycles keeps memory under control(See BU-807: How to restore Nickel-based Batteries)\nLi-ion self-discharges about 5 percent in the first 24 hours and then loses 1–2 percent per month; the protection circuit adds another 3 percent per month. A faulty separator can lead to elevated self-discharge that could develop into a current path, generating heat and, in an extreme case, initiate a thermal breakdown. In terms of self-discharge, lead acid is similar to Li-ion. Table 3 summarizes the expected self-discharge of different battery systems.\nThe self-discharge of all battery chemistries increases at higher temperature, and the rate typically doubles with every 10°C (18°F). A noticeable energy loss occurs if a battery is left in a hot vehicle. High cycle count and aging also increase self-discharge of all systems. Nickel-metal-hydride is good for 300–400 cycles, whereas the standard nickel-cadmium lasts for over 1,000 cycles before elevated self-discharge starts interfering with performance. The self-discharge on an older nickel-based battery can get so high that the pack goes flat from leakage rather than normal use(See BU-208: Cycling Performance demonstrating the relationship of capacity, internal resistance and self-discharge)\nUnder normal circumstances the self-discharge of Li-ion is reasonably steady throughout its service life; however, full state-of-charge and elevated temperature cause an increase. These same factors also affect longevity. Furthermore, a fully charged Li-ion is more prone to failure than one that is partially charged. Table 4 shows the self-discharge per month of Li-ion at various temperatures and state-of-charge. The high self-discharge at full state-of-charge and high temperatures comes as a surprise(See BU-808: How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries)\nLithium-ion should not be discharged below 2.50V/cell. The protection circuit turns off and most chargers will not charge the battery in that state. A “boost” program applying a gentle charge current to wake up the protection circuit often restores the battery to full capacity(See BU-803a: How to Awaken Sleeping Li-ion)\nThere are reasons why Li-ion is put to sleep when discharging below 2.50V/cell. Copper dendrites grow if the cell is allowed to dwell in a low-voltage state for longer than a week. This results in elevated self-discharge, which could compromise safety.\nSelf-discharge mechanisms must also be observed in manufacturing. They vary from corrosion to impurities in the electrodes that reflect in self-discharge variations not only from batch to batch but also form cell to cell. A quality manufacturer checks the self-discharge of each cell and rejects those that fall outside tolerances.\nRegular charge and discharge causes an unwanted deposit of lithium metal on the anode (negative electrode) of Li-ion, resulting in capacity loss through a depletion of the lithium inventory and the possibility of creating an internal short circuit. An internal short is often preceded with elevated self-discharge, a field that needs further research to learn what levels of self-discharge would pose a hazard that can lead to a thermal runaway. Unwanted lithium deposition also increases the internal resistance that reduces loading capability.\nFigure 5 compares the self-discharge of a new Li-ion cell with a cell that underwent forced deep discharges and one that was fully discharged, shorted for 14 days and then recharged. The cell that was exposed to deep discharges beyond 2.50V/cell shows a slightly higher self-discharge than a new cell. The largest self-discharge is visible with the cell that was stored at zero volts.\nFigure 6 illustrates the self-discharge of a lead acid battery at different ambient temperatures At a room temperature of 20°C (68°F), the self-discharge is roughly 3% per month and the battery can theoretically be stored of 12 months without recharge. With a warm temperature of 30°C (86°F), the self-discharge increases and a recharge will be needed after 6 months. Letting the battery drop below 60 percent SoC for some time causes sulfation(See also BU-702: How to Store Batteries)\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex\n[2] Source: TU München\n[3] Source: Power-Sonic\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

I sure am curious to learn if you found out anything as surprisingly it appears there are no comments or responses yet.\nI read once that submarine lead acid batteries were found to self discharge due to the difference in temperature between their base which was in contact with the cold hull and the warmer room temperature, causing a circulating flow in the electrolyte.  So the engineers insulated them from the hull.

        "title": "How to Care for the Battery",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/how-to-care-for-the-battery",
        "content": "The numbers of battery conferences are growing, but the agendas are similar — portraying a super battery that does not yet exist. With a grant of $120 million from the US Department of Energy, the Joint Centre for Energy Storage Research (JCESR) wants to develop a battery that is “five times more powerful and five times cheaper than current systems in five years.” They call this the 5-5-5 Plan. Universities are also involved but battery manufacturers are much further ahead. Additives that govern performance to a large extent are guarded as a top secret by each manufacturer.Toyota had already been searching for the super battery in 1925. They called this the “Sakichi battery” after Sakichi Toyoda, the inventor of Japan’s power loom and the founder of Toyota Motors. He is often called the father of the Japanese industrial revolution. It is said that Mr. Toyoda promised the yet-to-be-claimed prize of 1 million yen for a storage battery that produces more energy than gasoline. To qualify for the price, the Sakichi battery must be durable and quick to charge.Progress is being made but not without roadblocks. Lithium-air proposed in the 1970’s with a theoretical specific energy resembling gasoline is being delayed due to air-purity issues; the urban air that the battery “breaths” is not clean enough. The promising lithium-metal introduced in the 1980s still grows dendrites, leading to violent events with flame if an electrical short develops. There is much talk about the solid-state battery that shares similarity with lithium-metal, but scientists must also solve the dendrite problem here, as well as improve low conductivity at cooler temperatures and short cycle life. Lithium sulfur may be close to commercialization but the short cycle life also troubles this system. The redox-flow battery could offer a solution for large battery systems by pumping “charged” fluids from external tanks through a membrane, but this refinery-like battery suffers from corrosion. There is a glimmer of hope for Li-ion by coating the anode with graphene, a layer that is only one atom thick. This is said to quadruple the capacity, but such a battery is still miles away.As part of a survey, a consulting firm asked me what advancements battery users want to see in a battery and he gave me list of options to choose from. Will this be a 25 percent increase in energy density; a 25 percent boost in discharge rate; a 25 percent improvement in temperature range and safety; or will this be a 25 percent reduction in size and weight?I explained that a better battery does not rest on such enhancements alone but in knowing the performance of each pack in the field. This is seldom mentioned and a biomed technician said: “Batteries are the most abused components; staff care little about them and only do the bare minimum to service them.” He added further that, “references to battery maintenance are vague and hidden deep inside service manuals.”\nAgencies, such as the FDA, realize the lack of oversight on the battery for critical devices and have identified three problem areas they are trying to resolve:\nBatteries in the military also fail, and often without warning. A modern soldier carries radios, GPS devices, smartphones, night vision goggles, infrared sights, flashlights and counter-IED equipment. This amounts to roughly seven battery types, with 10 packs each for a 72-hour mission at a weight of about 9kg (20 lb) per solider. Reports indicate that batteries have become the second highest expense next to munitions. Without periodic performance checks, soldiers will carry rocks instead of batteries as Figure 1 demonstrates.\nOther uses where the condition of a battery must be supervised are drones and robots. Drones are hard on the battery and the capacity fades quickly, reducing the flight time. As drones are used for many unique commercial applications, fleet maintenance cannot be limited to knowing the state-of-charge alone but also recording state-of-health, the energy storage capability based on capacity. Knowing the anticipated flight time will prevent an expensive vehicle from crashing on a longer than expected mission, struggling against headwind or attempting a second landing.\nMost failures occurring during emergencies are caused by weak batteries as heavier than normal traffic depletes them prematurely. Capacity as a measure of performance evaluation and end of life indication is poorly understood. When asking a battery user: “At what capacity do you replace the battery?” most reply in confusion: “I beg your pardon?” The leading health indicators in a battery are: [1] capacity that stores the energy, [2] internal resistance that enables current delivery, and [3] self-discharge that reflects the mechanical integrity and reveals stress-related damage. With average use, Li-ion provides 300 to 500 full discharge cycles before the capacity drops to about 80 percent, marking the end-of-life. Low capacity is the most common cause of failure; the capacity level also serves as benchmark when a battery should be replaced.While improving battery performance is important – and the high attendance list at battery seminars proves this – not enough emphasis is placed on the battery once the pack enters active duty. Product development and agency approval are only pre-operational services alike the education of a youngster. While this is important to build a career, the workforce that follows is the proof of endurance. Batteries age and capacity-fade is as certain as death and taxes, a comment Benjamin Franklin made in 1789.Battery diagnostics and monitoring have lagged behind other technologies but an industrial revolution in batteries is in the works. In the 1970s, the world had computers but little software. Bill Gates changed this with the PC and shared software. Today, the world evolves around batteries but lacks supervision as part of control technology. Future systems will assess battery performance during charge or by a rapid-test and make the results transparent to the battery user and fleet manager alike.\nAbout the AuthorIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "title": "Does the Battery Fuel Gauge Lie?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/does-the-battery-fuel-gauge-lie",
        "content": "Measuring stored energy in an electrochemical device, such as a battery, is complex and state-of-charge (SoC) readings on a fuel gauge provide only a rough estimate. Users often compare battery SoC with the fuel gauge of a vehicle. Calculating fluid in a tank is simple because a liquid is a tangible entity; battery state-of-charge is not. Nor can the energy stored in a battery be quantified becauseprevailing conditions such as load current and operating temperature influence its release. A battery works best when warm; performance suffers when it is cold. In addition, a battery loses capacity through aging. Current fuel gauge technologies are fraught with limitations and this came to light when users of the new iPad assumed that a 100 percent charge on the fuel gauge should also relate to a fully charged battery. This is not always so and users complained that the battery was only at 90 percent.The modern fuel gauge used in iPads, smartphones and laptops read SoC through coulomb counting and voltage comparison. The complexity lies in managing these variables when the battery is in use. Applying a charge or discharge acts like a rubber band, pulling the voltage up or down, making a calculated SoC reading meaningless. In open circuit condition, as is the case when measuring a naked battery, a voltage reference may be used; however temperature and battery age will affect the reading. The open terminal voltage as a SoC reference is only reliable when including these environmental conditions and allowing the battery to rest for a few hours before the measurement. In the case of the iPad, a 10 percent discrepancy between fuel gauge and true battery SoC is acceptable for consumer products. The accuracy will likely drop further with use, and depending on the effectiveness of a self-learning algorithm, battery aging can add another 20-30 percent to the error. By this time the user has gotten used to the quirks of the device and the oddity is mostly forgotten or accepted. While differences in the runtime cause only a mild inconvenience to a casual user, industrial applications, such as the electric powertrain in an electric vehicle, will need a better system. Improvements are in the work, and these developments may one day also benefit consumer products. Coulomb counting is the heart of today’s fuel gauge. The theory goes back 250 years when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb first established the “Coulomb Rule.” It works on the principle of measuring in-and-out flowing currents. Coulomb counting also produces errors; the outflowing energy is always less than what goes in. Inefficiencies in charge acceptance, especially towards the end of charge, tracking errors, as well as losses during discharge and self-discharge while in storage contribute to this. Self-learning and periodic calibrations through a full charge/discharge assure an accuracy most can live with.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "The Smart Battery",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/the-smart-battery",
        "content": "NOTE: This article has been archived. Please read our new \"Inner Workings of a Smart Battery\" for an updated version.\nThe battery has the inherit problem of not being able to communicate with the user. Neither weight, color, nor size provides an indication of the battery's state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH). The user is at the mercy of the battery.\nHelp is at hand in breaking the code of silence. An increasing number of today's rechargeable batteries are made 'smart'. Equipped with a microchip, these batteries are able to communicate with the charger and user alike. Typical applications for 'smart' batteries are notebook computers and video cameras. Increasingly, these batteries are also used in biomedical devices and defense applications.There are several types of 'smart' batteries, each offering different complexities and costs. The most basic 'smart' battery may contain nothing more than a chip that sets the charger to the correct charge algorithm. In the eyes of the Smart Battery System (SBS) forum, these batteries cannot be called 'smart'.What then makes a battery 'smart'? Definitions still vary among organizations and manufacturers. The SBS forum states that a 'smart' battery must be able to provide SoC indications. In 1990, Benchmarq was the first company to commercialize the concept by offering fuel gauge technology. Today, several manufacturers produce such chips. They range from the single wire system, to the two-wire system to the System Management Bus (SMBus). Let's first look at the single wire system.\nThe single wire system delivers the data communications through one wire. This battery uses three wires: the common positive and negative battery terminals and one single data terminal, which also provides the clock information. For safety reasons, most battery manufacturers run a separate wire for temperature sensing. Figure 1 shows the layout of a single wire system.\nThe single wire system stores the battery code and tracks battery readings, including temperature, voltage, current and SoC. Because of relatively low hardware cost, the single wire system enjoys market acceptance for high-end two-way radios, camcorders and portable computing devices.Most single wire systems do not provide a common form factor; neither do they lend themselves to standardized SoH measurements. This produces problems for a universal charger concept. The Benchmarq single wire solution, for example, cannot measure the current directly; it must be extracted from a change in capacity over time. In addition, the single wire bus allows battery SoH measurement only when the host is 'married' to a designated battery pack. Such a fixed host-battery relationship is only feasible if the original battery is used. Any discrepancy in the battery will make the system unreliable or will provide false readings.\nThe SMBus is the most complete of all systems. It represents a large effort from the electronics industry to standardize on one communications protocol and one set of data. The Duracell/Intel SBS, which is in use today, was standardized in 1993. It is a two-wire interface system consisting of separate lines for the data and clock. Figure 2 shows the layout of the two-wire SMBus system.\nThe objective behind the SMBus battery is to remove the charge control from the charger and assign it to the battery. With a true SMBus system, the battery becomes the master and the charger serves as slave that must follow the dictates of the battery. Battery-controlled charging makes sense when considering that some packs share the same footprint but contain different chemistries, requiring alternative charge algorithms. With the SMBus, each battery receives the correct charge levels and terminates full-charge with proper detection methods. Future battery chemistries will be able to use the existing chargers.An SMBus battery contains permanent and temporary data. The permanent data is programmed into the battery at the time of manufacturing and includes battery ID number, battery type, serial number, manufacturer's name and date of manufacture. The temporary data is acquired during use and consists of cycle count, user pattern and maintenance requirements. Some of this information is renewed during the life of the battery.The SMBus is divided into Level 1, 2 and 3. Level 1 has been eliminated because it does not provide chemistry independent charging. Level 2 is designed for in-circuit charging. A laptop that charges its battery within the unit is a typical example of Level 2. Another Level 2 application is a battery that contains the charging circuit within the pack. Level 3 is reserved for full-featured external chargers.External Level 3 chargers are complex and expensive. Some lower cost chargers have emerged that accommodate SMBus batteries but are not fully SBS compliant. Manufacturers of SMBus batteries do not fully endorse this shortcut. Safety is always a concern, but customers buy them because of low cost. Serious industrial battery users operating biomedical instruments, data collection devices and survey equipment use Level 3 chargers with full-fledged charge protocol. Among the most popular SMBus batteries are the 35 and 202 form-factors (Figure 3). Manufactured by Sony, Hitachi, GP Batteries, Moli Energy and others, these batteries work (should work) in all portable equipment designed for this system. Although the 35 has a smaller footprint than the 202, most chargers accommodate both sizes. A non-SMBus ('dumb') version with same footprint is also available. These batteries can only be charged with a regular charger, or one that accepts both types.\nIn spite of the agreed standard and given form factors, many computer manufacturers have retained their proprietary batteries. Safety, performance and form factor are the reasons. They argue that enduring performance can only be guaranteed if their own brand battery is used. This makes common sense but the leading motive may be pricing. In the absence of competition, these batteries can be sold for a premium price.\nThe 'smart' battery has some notable downsides, one of which is price. An SMBus battery costs about 25% more than the 'dumb' equivalent. In addition, the 'smart' battery was intended to simplify the charger but a full-fledged Level 3 charger costs substantially more than a regular model.A more serious drawback is the requirements for periodic calibration or capacity re-learning. The Engineering Manager of Moli Energy, a manufacturer of lithium-ion cell commented, \"With lithium-ion we have eliminated the memory effect; but is the SMBus battery introducing digital memory?\"Why is calibration needed? The calibration corrects the tracking errors that occur between the battery and the digital sensing circuit while charging and discharging. The most ideal battery application, as far as fuel-gauge accuracy is concerned, would be a full charge followed by a full discharge at a constant current. In such a case, the tracking error would be less than 1% per cycle. In real life, however, a battery may be discharged for only a few minutes and the load pulses may be very short. Long storage also contributes to errors because the circuit cannot accurately compensate for self-discharge. Eventually, the true capacity of the battery no longer synchronizes with the fuel gauge and a full charge and discharge is needed to 're-learn' the battery.How often is calibration needed? The answer lies in the battery application. For practical purposes, a calibration is recommended once every three months or after every 40 short cycles. Many batteries undergo periodic full discharges as part of regular use. If the portable device allows a deep enough discharge to reset the battery and this is done regularly, no additional calibration is needed. However, if no discharge reset has occurred for a few months, a deliberate full discharge is needed. This can be done on a charger with discharge function or a battery analyzer.What happens if the battery is not calibrated regularly? Can such a battery be used in confidence? Most 'smart' battery chargers obey the dictates of the chemical cells rather than the electronic circuit. In this case, the battery will fully charge regardless of the fuel gauge setting and function normally, but the digital readout will become inaccurate. If not corrected, the fuel gauge simply becomes a nuisance.An addition problem with the SMBus battery is non-compliance. Unlike other tightly regulated standards, the SMBus protocol allows some variations. This may cause problems with existing chargers and the SMBus battery should be checked for compatibility before use. The need to test and approve the marriage between a specific battery and charger is unfortunate, given the assurance that the SMBus battery is intended to be universal. Ironically, the more features offered on the SMBus charger and the battery, the higher the likelihood of incompatibilities.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "A lead acid battery goes through three life phases: formatting, peak and decline (Figure 1). In the formatting phase, the plates are in a sponge-like condition surrounded by liquid electrolyte. Exercising the plates allows the absorption of electrolyte, much like squeezing and releasing a hardened sponge. As the electrodes activate, the capacity gradually increases.\nFormatting is most important for deep-cycle batteries. They require 20–50 full cycles to reach peak capacity and field usage does this. During breaking-in, manufacturers recommend going easy on the battery. Starter batteries are less critical and do not need priming. The full cranking power is available from the beginning, although CCA will go up slightly with formatting in early use(See BU-701: How to Prime Batteries)\nA deep-cycle battery delivers 100–200 cycles before a gradual decline begins. Replacement should occur when the capacity drops to 70 or 80 percent. Some applications allow lower capacity thresholds but the time for retirement should never fall below 50 percent as aging may hasten once past the prime.\nTo keep lead acid in good condition, apply a fully saturated charge lasting 14 to 16 hours. If the charge cycle does not allow this, give the battery a fully saturated charge once every few weeks. If at all possible, operate at moderate temperature and avoid deep discharges; charge as often as you can(See BU-403: Charging Lead Acid)\nThe primary reason for the relatively short cycle life of a lead acid battery is depletion of the active material. According to the 2010 BCI Failure Modes Study, plate/grid-related breakdown has increased from 30 percent 5 years ago to 39 percent today. The report does not provide reasons for the larger wear and tear other than to assume that higher demands on the starter battery in modern cars induce added stress. The organization conducts a study every 5 years to determine the failure modes of batteries that have been removed from service. (BCI stands for Battery Council International.)\nWhile the depletion of the active material is well understood and can be calculated, a lead acid battery suffers from other infirmities long before plate- and grid-deterioration sound the death knell. These conditions are found under: Corrosion, Shedding and internal Short, Sulfation and How to Prevent it, and Water Loss, Acid Stratification and Surface Charge. Most of these can be reduced by proper handling.\nAs battery care-giver, you have choices in how to prolong battery life. Each battery system has unique needs in terms of charging, depth of discharge and loading that should be observed.

We recommend posting your question in the comment sections for the Battery University Group (BUG) to share.\nI suggest that it isn't the starter demands of more modern cars that shortens battery life, but the slow drain by the car's electronics while OFF (car alarm, computer, clock, whatever).  I've noticed that modern vehicles will drain a battery within a couple months just sitting in the driveway, while very old cars can sit for almost a year.\nIs the death of lead acid batteries looming? They are horrible things full of environmentally unfriendly chemicals, have an inconsistent life span, and carry a huge weight penalty. Big and fat is ugly, time for the lead acid battery to be retired.\nComments from the previous website are not compatible with our new commenting system but we have preserved them so our users can still reference and make use the information in them.\nThe material on Battery University is based on the indispensable new 4th edition of \"Batteries in a Portable World - A Handbook on Rechargeable Batteries for Non-Engineers\" which is available for order through Amazon.com.\nBuy On Amazon"

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-413a-how-to-store-renewable-energy-in-a-battery",
        "content": "Solar Energy: Economists predict rapid growth in micro-grid technology using batteries. Environmentally conscious Germany, Japan, Australia and other countries have made use of solar panels for many years to reduce energy costs. In parts of Africa where the AC grid is not sufficiently developed to support all household activities, solar panels with battery backup are mandatory.\nPersonal energy production is moving to the US Sunbelt; cheaper solar panels and longer-lasting batteries make this attractive. Batteries store energy during peak production when output is in over-supply to bridge the gap when free energy goes to rest at night or when the wind stops. Batteries will moderate peak consumption when the AC grid is stressed to the breaking point.\nRenewable energy makes economic sense, but it is expensive. Most of the Western World is served with cheap and reliable electricity from the AC grid with a per kilowatt-hour cost as low as US $0.06 in parts of Canada, to $0.15 in many cities and up to $0.40 in some European countries. Electricity produced by a solar panel comes in at about $0.20 per kWh. When including peripheral expenses, solar power in most parts of the world is more expensive than buying electricity from the utilities, and as a rough guideline, stored energy doubles the price.\nIn spite of the apparent higher cost, putting solar panels on houses is becoming fashionable. Hardware prices are falling and so is the installation. The most common photovoltaic (PV) solar cells are the crystalline silicon type with efficiency of about 20 percent. Flexible panels for portable use, in comparison, have an efficiency of only about 10 percent. The hardware costs to generate 1 watt of electricity with solid panels is $2.00–2.50, with cost trending lower.\nIn solar-rich countries where electricity is expensive, energy from solar panels is being fed back to the AC grid. This causes the electrical meter to spin backwards, offsetting previously consumed energy, but it can also induce a problem. The amount of power generated cannot exceed consumption. Dumping more energy into the grid than consumed makes the system unstable, resulting in voltage fluctuations that can overload the circuit and lead to brownouts.\nRenewable energy has friends and foes in high places. On one side, governments hand out subsidies to install renewable energy systems, while on the other side utilities try desperately to stem the move of home electricity generation by reducing incentives and adding fees. The utilities argue that spurious energy production by homeowners complicates control and cuts into the revenue stream. They see it as creating glut and famine by means of excess supply during times of plenty and famine when demand is high but renewable contributions are not available.\nThe conflict is understandable because utility companies are responsible for providing stable energy at all times while independent producers are unable to reduce the concern of pending failure caused by an aging grid that moans during peak demand. Right or wrong, producing clean energy from a renewable resource should never be curtailed, especially if the resource can be stored, and solar companies are fighting back through regulators, lawmakers and the courts.\nPumped hydro: Storing electrical energy is not new. One of the most effective storage media for large hydroelectric power stations is to pump water back up to the reservoir during low electrical demand and make it available during peak times. With an efficiency factor of 70–85 percent, pumped hydro is easier to manage than adjusting the generators to satisfy fluctuating power needs. Flywheels also serve as energy storage. Large electric motors spin one-ton flywheels when excess energy is available to fill brief energy deficiencies and stabilize the grid. Pumping compressed air into large underground cavities is another way to store energy but for small to medium installations, batteries work best. (See BU-1001: Batteries in Industries)\nFlywheels serve as energy storage in lieu of batteries. Large electric motors spin one-ton flywheels when excess energy is available to fill brief energy deficiencies and stabilize the grid. High-speed flywheels whirl at 30,000–50,000 rpm often on magnetic bearings in a vacuum chamber. Electric motors/generators with permanent magnets charge and discharge kinetic energy on demand.\nFlywheels deliver high power density rather than excessive energy. Whereas a modern Li-ion battery has a specific energy of 250Wh/kg, the equivalent in a flywheel is about 5Wh/kg, but the specific power is up to 2500W/kg, a level that is 10-times higher than a Li-ion battery.\nIn terms of delivering power, the flywheel has comparable qualities to the supercapacitor. See: BU-209: How does a Supercapacitor Work? A flywheel maker says: “For applications <20–30kW you'd rather use supercaps. Above this power requirement, the flywheel offers advantages.” In terms of longevity, the flywheel delivers a few million full cycles whereas the longevity of the supercap is around 500,000 cycles. The drawback of the flywheel is mechanical wear-and-tear with mechanical bearings.\nCompressed Air: Pumping compressed air into large underground cavities is another way to store energy. Such systems provide energy for large installations in lieu of batteries. (See BU-1001: Batteries in Industries) Compressed air is not in common used. It needs access to a large pool of water and the cavity in the form of a balloon can be punctured.\nCompressed air in underground caverns is an interesting effort that didn’t work out as planned. Inefficiencies by turbulent losses, leakage of underground caverns and cost to build the system work against this innovative effort. Money and talent cannot solve every problem.\nOther mechanical energy storage systems are elevating weight in a tower and building a railroad that pulls a loaded car up the tracks, and the releasing as energy storage. Tidal turbines are also used with various rates of successes.\nBattery Chemistries: Storage batteries have mostly been lead acid and users complain about their short life span. This is in part caused by excessive cycling as the battery charges during the day and discharges at night. Lead acid has a limited cycle count and suffers from sulfation when not periodically fully charged. A fully saturated charge takes 16 hours, and no solar system can deliver energy for this long. In addition, electrical consumption tends to increase with time while the solar panels reduce their output due to dirt buildup and aging. This often leaves lead acid with insufficient charge.\nThe switch to Li-ion solves this in part. Li-ion is more resistant to cycling than lead acid and does not need to be fully charged; in fact a partial charge is better as it relieves stress. But Li-ion is still double or three times the cost of lead acid in terms of system purchase.\nThe Tesla Powerwall offers a 7kWh and a 10kWh battery, enough energy to keep a home lit for several hours. Both packs have the same number of cells; the 7kWh battery uses the robust NMC that is used in many industrial applications while the 10kWh makes use of the NCA that powers the Tesla S-models. NCA offers high energy density and short charge time, while the NMC delivers a high cycle count at a lower capacity. (See BU-205: Types of Lithium-ion)\nBoth the NCA and NMC are Energy Cells that dislike heavy loads. The power of the Powerwall is limited to 2kW. This is sufficient to run a fridge, brown toast and perhaps iron a shirt, but the wattage is too low to cook a meal on an electric stove, run an electric dryer or keep the air conditioner going; high-energy appliances consume more than 2kW. To fill the gap, the AC grid kicks in seamlessly during peak household activity. A 10kWh battery with 2kW peak power cannot disconnect a household from the grid, but it reduces the electrical bill by one third to one half.\nTo fully charge a 10kWh battery during 5 hours of optimal sunshine requires a solar system that delivers 5–12kW. At an estimated cost of $2 per watt, the 10kW solar hardware comes in at $20,000. Installation and the DC-AC inverter to convert the solar DC to compatible AC power and synchronize it with the grid might double the cost. The battery will be extra also.\nAnother hidden cost that is often overlooked is end-of-life. Solar panels have a life span of 25 years and batteries are commonly guaranteed for 10 years. At a cost-of-money of 5 percent and a 20 year amortization, a $25,000 system could cost the owner $2,500 per year. The energy savings should be greater than this or else the exercise may be misconstrued. Even larger energy savings can be made by reducing personal transportation or scaling down on the size and power of such a carriage.\n[1] Source: Elliot Green Power[2] Source: Nant de Drance\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-308: Availability of Lithium",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-308-availability-of-lithium",
        "content": "Over the last two decades, the lithium-ion battery has caused a transformation in the consumption of metals and minerals. The landscape is expected to change further as the Li-ion battery evolves from portable applications, such as the mobile phone with a small 10 watt-hours (Wh) pack, to the electric vehicle with a battery capacity of 50–100kWh, and to the monster Energy Storage System (ESS) with up to 10MWh battery banks. At the start of the millennium, only a small percentage of cobalt and lithium went into batteries, but by 2015 46 percent of cobalt and 32 percent of lithium went into Li-ion production. Graphite, nickel manganese, copper and aluminum have not been affected in the same way.\nFinding sufficient supply of lithium in raw material is gearing up mining industries for higher production. A compact EV battery (Nissan Leaf) uses about 4kg (9 lb) of lithium, and if every man, woman and teenager were to drive an electric car in the future, a lithium shortage could develop. Rumor of such a shortage developing has been spreading, perhaps prematurely, although the price of lithium will fluctuate according to supply and demand.\nAbout 70 percent of the world’s lithium comes from brine (salt lakes); the remainder is derived from hard rock. Research institutions are developing technology to draw lithium from seawater. China is the largest consumer of lithium, and hoarding is suspected. The Chinese believe that future cars will run on Li-ion batteries and an unbridled supply of lithium is important to them.\nIn 2009, the total demand for lithium reached almost 92,000 metric tons, of which batteries consume 26 percent. Figure 1 illustrates typical uses of lithium, which include lubricants, glass, ceramics, pharmaceuticals and refrigeration.\nBatteries consume the largest share of lithium. With the advent of the electric vehicle, the demand could skyrocket but for now the world has enough proven lithium reserves. COVID-19 in 2020 put a temporary break on lithium demand.\nMost of the known lithium supply is in Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, Australia and China. The quality is acceptable and reports reveal that Brazil has lithium mineral reserves that are not only of higher quality but also have lower extraction costs. In 2019, meanwhile, Western Australia has become the number one global producer of lithium, the second largest global producer of rare earths, the third largest global producer of cobalt and the fourth largest global producer of nickel.\nThe supply is ample and concerns of global shortages are speculative. To attain one ton of lithium, Latin America uses 750 tons of brine, the base material for lithium, and adds 24 months of preparation. Lithium can also be recycled an unlimited number of times, but no recycling technology exists today that is capable of producing pure enough lithium for a second use in batteries. It is said that 20 tons of spent Li-ion batteries yield one ton of lithium. This will help the supply, but recycling can be more expensive than harvesting a new supply through mining.\nLithium is commonly sourced from brine, a water and energy intensive process. According to www.foeeurope.org, 0.05-1 mg of lithium requires 1 liter of brine/mineral water. Areas rich in lithium are often arid and this increases the cost of mining. Dry and salty conditions can also take a toll on human health. Seawater extraction is a more expensive way to mine lithium. In addition, extraction and refining of lithium metal pollutes the environment.\nLithium is named after the Greek word “lithos” meaning “stone.” The soft, silver-white metal belongs to the alkali metal group of chemical elements and is marked with the symbol Li. It is the lightest of all metals.\nMost Li-ion batteries do not contain lithium in metallic form but in metal oxide. This is in contrast to the metallic lithium battery that uses lithium for the anode (see BU-212: Future Batteries). Most metallic lithium batteries available today are non-rechargeable (see BU-106a: Choices of Primary Batteries).\nWhen exposed to oxygen, lithium forms an oxide layer similar to rust on iron that changes the appearance. Exposing lithium to water produces hydrogen and lithium hydroxide. With the presence of oxygen (O2) in the air and hydrogen (H2) produced, the heat created by the reaction can lead to a spontaneous ignition.\nThe lithium raw material in a Li-ion battery is only a fraction of one cent per watt, or less than 1 percent of the battery cost. A $10,000 battery for a plug-in hybrid contains less than $100 worth of lithium. Shortages when producing millions of large batteries for vehicles and stationary applications could increase the price, but for now this is not the case.\nRather than worrying about a lack of lithium, there could be shortages of rare earth materials, should the EV replace the conventional car. One such material is the permanent magnet for the electric motors. Permanent magnets make one of the most energy-efficient motors. China controls about 95 percent of the global market for rare earth metals and expects to use most of these resources for its own production. Export of rare earth materials is tightly controlled.\n[1] Source: Roskill 2019\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-1004: Charging an Electric Vehicle",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-1004-charging-an-electric-vehicle",
        "content": "If you own an EV, you want to pamper the battery and charge the car at home and at the office. The power requirements to charge a mid-sized EV is similar to that of an electric stove connected to a 40A, 240VAC circuit developing up to 9.6kW. Most mid-sized EVs carry a 6.6kW on-board charger designed for a 4- to 5-hour charge. (6.6kW is derived by multiplying 220V by 30A.)\nOn-board chargers are limited by cost, size and thermal issues. With the availability of three-phase AC power in most European residences, on-board chargers can be made smaller than with a two-phase system. Renault offers compact on-board chargers that range from 3–43kW.\nThe hookup to charge an EV is called the Electric Vehicle Service Equipment (EVSE). Except for Level 1, all must be installed by an electrician if not already available. There are three categories of charging.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, EV makers made a concerted effort to develop a universal charging port for EVs and this resulted in the SAE J1772, a 5-pin connector carrying AC and data. The drawback is a charge time pursuant to Level 2 that takes several hours.\nEV makers agree that the future of the EV lies in fast charging. While Level 2 only gains about 40km (25 miles) per hour charge, DC Fast Charging fills the battery to 80 percent in 30 minutes. This changes the EV from a commuter car into a touring vehicle, and EV marketing has started to push the concept.\nJapan was first to introduce DC Fast Charging by developing the CHAdeMO connector for the Nissan Leaf and Mitsubishi MiEV. JEVS (Japan Electric Vehicle Standard) specified the connector that includes two large DC pins with communications pins for the CAN-BUS. The CHAdeMO standard was formed by TEPCO (The Tokyo Electric Power Company), Nissan, Mitsubishi, Fuji Heavy Industries (manufacturer of Subaru vehicles) and Toyota in 2008. It charges a battery at 500VDC and 125A with up to 62.5kW charging power. CHAdeMO stands for “CHArge on the Move;” Figure 1 illustrates the plug.\nNissan and Mitsubishi lead DC fast charging and developed CHAdeMO. It fast-charges at 500VDC and 125A, developing up to 62.5kW of power.\nWhile the CHAdeMO connector performs well, the West lobbied against it, citing “technical issues.” The reason for this may be the “not invented in my backyard” syndrome as well as a standard that favors certain brands of cars. SAE rejected CHAdeMO in favor of their version.\nAfter much delay, the SAE International J1772 Committee released the SAE DC Fast Charging standard in 2012, a system that is also known as the Combo Charging System (CCS). The delay caused a setback in building the CHAdeMO infrastructure and some argue that the postponement was deliberate.\nTo keep compatibility with Level 2 charging, CCS is based on the existing J1772 connector by adding two DC pins. When charging on AC, the circular connector provides AC power and communications to govern voltage, charge rate and end-of-charge. DC Fast Charging uses the same communications protocol but adds the DC pins. Figure 2 illustrates the charging connectors for AC and DC charging with the vehicle inlet.\nCCS allows Level 2 charging by connecting to the upper circular receptacle only, and Level 3 charging with a plug that includes the DC terminals.SAE J1772 divides charging into four levels:\nThe SAE Combo or CCS is the de facto global standard for Level 2 and 3 charging and Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche and Volkswagen jointly announced their support in 2011. The Chevy Spark was the first EV to feature the SAE Combo in 2013. There is now talk to discontinue the CHAdeMO. To maintain compatibility with EVs featuring CHAdeMO, newer Nissan Leafs include an SAE J1772 port to allow Level 2 charging. Some charger manufacturers, including ABB, offer both charging plugs at their “pumps.”\nTesla Motors does not follow standards easily, and they came up with their own system. Their exclusive Supercharger fills a depleted battery to 80 percent in 40 minutes and gives a driving range of 270km. (Charging from 80–100 percent doubles the time.) While Tesla was criticized by some for introducing their Superchargers, others say that Tesla is way ahead of the game and did not want to wait for the world to get its standards right. Tesla is in discussions with Nissan and BMW to offer their Supercharger standard to these EV makers as well. They are also working on an inter-protocol charging adapter that can support the CHAdeMO and SAE J1772 systems.\nCharging the Tesla S 85 on a Supercharger begins at a voltage of about 375V and 240A, consuming 90kW. As the battery fills, the voltage rises to about 390VDC and the current drops to roughly 120A. The initial 90kW into the 85kWh battery has a charge rate that is only slightly higher than 1C. After a brief moment, the C-rate falls to a comfortable 0.8C, and then goes down further, avoiding harmful battery stress that is related to ultrafast charging.\nBattling three incompatible charging systems was not the plan for EV makers, but it occurred in part by not accepting available technologies and delaying their own standards. Tesla jumped ahead with their own technology and is investing heavily into building Superchargers and offering free charging; other EV makers have followed by also making charging free, at least for now. The resulting incompatibility has similarities with the railroads industry in the 1800s, when railway companies ran their trains on different track gauges. LP vs. 45 RPM, as well as Sony Beta vs. VHS are other examples of similar situation.\nBMW with its SAE Combo Charging system chose 24kW rather than the more common 50kW for the DC Fast Charger. They reckon that 24 kW is cheaper, lighter and easier to install than a 50kW system. While 50kW would charge faster, the benefit is for a brief moment only before the charge acceptance degrades. Scaling down is especially apparent with the smaller i3 battery, as well as packs that cannot take the ultra-fast charge due to advanced age and other anomalies. Tests show that the 50 kW charger fills a battery to 80 percent in about 20 minutes; the 24 kW charger does it in roughly 30 minutes.\nDoubling the power does not cut the charge time in half and moving up in the pyramid has diminishing returns. The main reason for powerful chargers relates to battery size. The BMW i3 carries a 22kW battery compared to the monster 85kW in the Tesla S 85. Both charging systems keep the charge C-rate at about 1C during DC fast charging to moderate battery stress levels.\nDC fast charging is more complex in that it must evaluate the condition of the battery and apply a charge level that the battery can safely absorb. A cold battery must be charged slower than a warm one; the charge current must also be reduced when cells develop high internal resistance and when the balancing circuit can no longer compensate for cell mismatch. (See BU-410: Charging at High and Low Temperature) DC Fast Charging is not designed to fill the battery completely but to allow the vehicle to reach the next charging station. Using Level 2 is the preferred routine for everyday charging.\nTable 3 summarizes the charge levels and times with Levels 1, 2 and 3. The charge times may not fully agree with advertised rates as the calculations are based on charging an empty battery to fully SoC; some EV makers consider the battery charged when it reaches 80 percent. The charge time also shortens as the battery fades because there is less to fill.\nTable 3: Estimated charging times on Electric Vehicle Service Equipment (EVSE). EVs carry the charging circuit on board and the most common is the 6.6kW system, Tesla has 10kW charger.\n* Tesla EVs come with 10kW and 20kW chargers; Renault uses 3–43kW 3-phase on-board chargers** A 30-amp EVSE needs a 40A circuit breaker some EVs come with larger on-board chargers\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-304-why-are-protection-circuits-needed",
        "content": "Batteries can release high energies and the safety requirements for nickel- and lithium-based batteries and cells for portable applications are harmonized under IEC 62133. The standard came into effect in 2012 to reduce the global risk in transporting, storing and operating batteries.\nThe most basic safety device in a battery is a fuse that opens on high current. Some fuses open permanently and render the battery useless; others are more forgiving and reset. Figure 1 illustrates the top of an 18650 cell for Li-ion with built-in safety features.\nThe resistance of the positive thermal coefficient (PTC) (blue) is low during normal operation and increases when the temperature rises above a critical level to reduce current flow. The PTC is reversible and returns to high conductivity when the temperature normalizes.\nThe current interrupt device (CID) is a fuse-type device that cuts off the electrical circuit permanently when triggered by excessive cell pressure, high temperature, or high voltage, depending on design. In Figure 1, the CID operates by pressure. When the internal pressure increases to about 1,000kPa, the scored top disk (orange) breaks, separates from the metallic foil (brown) and disconnects the current flow. This also allows gas to vent.\nThe last safety device is the vent that releases gas during an anomaly and can be resealed. However, the pressure of a disintegrating cell can be so large that the gases are unable to escape in an orderly way and venting with flame occurs. In some cases the top of the cell escapes like a bullet from a shotgun. Similar to a nuclear meltdown that cannot be stopped once in progress; a Li-ion battery once in disintegration should be allowed to burn out in a safe place with ventilation.\nPTC (blue) increases resistance by heat to reduce electrical current. The effect is reversible. CID consists of a top disk (orange) that breaks under pressure and permanently disconnects the current flow.\nProtection devices have a residual resistance that causes a slight decrease in overall performance due to a resistive voltage drop. Not all cells have built-in protections and the responsibility for safety in its absence falls to the Battery Management System (BMS).\nFurther layers of safeguards can include solid-state switches in a circuit that is attached to the battery pack to measure current and voltage and disconnect the circuit if the values are too high. Protection circuits for Li-ion packs are mandatory. (See BU-304b: Making Lithium-ion Safe)\nMore information on why batteries fail, what the user can do when a battery overheats and simple guidelines using Lithium-ion Batteries are described in BU-304a: Safety Concerns with Li-ion.\nSafety is vitally important when using electronic devices in hazardous areas. Intrinsic safety (IS) ensures harmless operation in areas where an electric spark could ignite flammable gas or dust. Hazardous areas include oil refineries, chemical plants, grain elevators and textile mills.\nAll electronic devices entering a hazardous area must be intrinsically safe. This includes two-way radios, mobile phones, laptops, cameras, flashlights, gas detectors, test devices and medical instruments, even when powered with primary AA and AAA cells. Intrinsically safe devices and batteries contain protection circuits that prevent excessive currents that could lead to high heat, sparks and explosion. The hazard levels are subdivided into these four disciplines.\nThe main classifications for intrinsic safety are divisions and zones. Division is typically used in North America; zone originated in Europe but is now used worldwide.

        "content": "The electric vehicle (EV) puts new demands on the battery and this modern energy source performs amazingly well in this new responsibility. But we ask: “Why does the battery in our mobile phones only last three years while the battery in an EV is good for more than 10 years?” Not all answers are known and the battery industry is littered with broken promises. Progress is being made but storing electrical energy economically remains one of our yet unresolved challenges in modern society.\nThe secret of longevity in the EV battery is oversizing and only operating in mid-range with plenty of “grace capacity” as spare in the upper and lower bands. Partial use reduces battery stress, but leaves valuable energy storage under-utilized. Oversizing also adds cost and weight, but this spare capacity will eventually get used when the capacity fades.\nCharging the battery to only 80% and discharging to 20%, as is typically done on a new EV battery, only utilizes 60% of the capacity. As charge acceptance fades with use and time, the onboard BMS demands a higher charge and a lower discharge to meet the driving range. This adjustment remains unnoticed by the driver until a reduction in driving range is noticed. This occurs when the “grace capacity” is consumed.\nTheoretically, depletion requires a full charge and full discharge to meet the energy requirements. At this point, battery stress increases and capacity fade accelerates, resulting in reduced driving range. This change is predictable and evolves over a few years of driving. Once the battery capacity has dropped to 70%, the EV can still be used for short commuting and errands. In most cases, capacity fade only reduces the driving range while power remains strong.\nThe mobile phone does not apply grace capacity to prolong battery life. In the interest of small size and long runtime, the battery is fully utilized from the beginning. From the user standpoint, it best not to discharge the mobile phone too deeply but charge it more often. Battery life can also be prolonged by a partial charge, but most chargers do not have a provision to set the charge limit. End-of-charge will need to be controlled manually. Phone manufacturers build in obsolesces that often correspond with a broken touchscreen or the desire for new features.\nMost EV batteries have an 8-year warranty or a 160,000km (100,000 mile) drive limit. Automakers in California are required to extend the warranty to 10 years or 240,000km (150,000 miles). The goal of USABC (United States Advanced Battery Consortium) is a 15 year battery life and 1,000 cycles by 2020. Research labs already report up to 2,000 EFC (equivalent full cycles). With 2,000 cycles at 250km (156 miles) each, an EV battery would be good for 500,000km (312,000 miles). But tests conducted in a lab tend to show better results than in real life.\nFigure 1 limits the driving range of a new battery by adding grace capacity shown in green. After about 900 cycles, the upper grace capacity is being consumed. Software adjustment can prolong battery life by adding more grace capacity as shown in the graph, but this reduces the driving range.\nWhen all grace capacity is consumed, the battery hypothetical needs a full charge and a deeper discharge to meet the driving range. This is when reduction in driving range becomes noticeable year by year(See also BU-1003: Electric Vehicle, Figure 5)\nA new battery has plenty of grace capacity that is gradually being depleted. Higher charge levels and a deeper discharge maintain the driving range but stresses increase. For this study, capacity drop in the grace range is 5% per 75,000km at first. This increases as the grace capacity is consumed.\nHistorical data from Tesla shows capacity degradation of about 5% after 80,000km (50,000 miles). EV manufacturers keep a close eye on battery performance and make adjustments when needed to extend battery longevity. In some cases this involves adding grace capacity, but this reduces driving range. The adjustment is done by a software upgrade at a service center or online with modern Tesla models. Some upgrades are mandatory to retain warranty and prolong battery life.\nFigure 2 illustrates the driving range of a Tesla EV model carrying an 85kWh battery as published on social media. Section 1 delivered a steady range up to 95,000 miles on the odometer reading. Section 2 demonstrates a 5% decrease in range, and Section 3 denotes a software upgrade at 130,000 miles. This reduces the driving range by about 10% by adding grace capacity.\nThe 38,800 mile odometer reading when records were first taken delivered a 247 mile range. After a software upgrade at 132,000 miles, the driving range is reduced to 218 miles. Software upgrade is sometimes needed to prolong battery life.\nBattery aging is complex and not always predicable. Usage is a product of age, cycle count, charge speed, load levels and temperature. The University of Munich (TUM) did extensive tests simulating batteries in an EV. The test battery is a NCA Li-ion in an 18650 package, the same cell found in a Tesla EV. The cathode material of this cell is nickel, cobalt and aluminum, the anode is graphite; 18640 outlines the cell size that is 16mm in diameter and 64mm in length(See BU-301a: Types of Battery Cells)\nFigure 3 investigates capacity fade as part of calendar aging over 700 days at different state-of-charge (SoC) levels and temperatures.\nLower charge voltages and cooler temperatures preserve the Li-ion battery when not in use.\nThe largest permanent capacity losses are recorded at a high charge voltage, high SoC and elevated temperature. None of the Li-ion cells were charged to 4.20V/cell to reach full SoC, as done with a mobile phone battery because the capacity loss would be large(See also BU-702: How to Store Batteries) Additional information is in BU-808: How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries, Table 3.\nReports reveal that under the right conditions capacity fade in storage can be kept below 10% in 15 years. Calendar aging and capacity fade by cycling are accumulative. Fading is not linear; the highest drop occurs at the beginning and fading slows with time. Experts believe that the high capacity loss at elevated temperatures is mainly caused by calendar aging rather than cycling.\nCharging takes lithium from the cathode and intercalates it on the anode. The process is most effective when the battery has low charge; charge acceptance slows towards saturation. An analogy is gobbling up food quickly when we are hungry.\nUltra-fast charging, or boost charging, must be done under the right conditions. Charge efficiency varies according to SoC and battery temperature. As a battery ages, the internal resistance and the cell balance worsen and the charge rate must be slowed accordingly.\nAn intelligent charger should read battery state-of-health (SoH) and only apply as much charge current as the battery can reasonably absorb. (See BU-401a: Fast and Ultra-fast Chargers) In as similar way, an old man is perfectly fine to run a marathon as long as his exertion is controlled. Determining the maximum charging current is challenging and effective battery diagnostic technologies are still in development.\nEnergy cells should be charged at a C-rate below 1C (see BU-402: What Is C-rate?) At 1C, the Li-ion battery is charged to about 90% in one hour at a current that is equal to the battery’s Ah rating. Charging an 85kWh battery at 1C draws 85kW, the power five average households consume.\nGoing above 1C increases stress that reflects in rapid capacity degradation. Ultrafast charging is most effective between a SoC of 20–50%. The onboard BMS only applies full boosts in this level where charge acceptance is highest before lowering the current to a more moderate level.\nThe power cell is more rugged and can be charged faster than the energy cell. Power cells are commonly used for power tools. They deliver high current, have a wide temperature range but store less energy than the energy cell. See also BU-501a: Discharge Characteristics of Li-ion\nIf you ultra-fast charge the EV battery too often, the BMS may permanently lower the current by a few kilowatts. Instead of 120kW on a Supercharger, the charging power may drop to 90kW, prolonging the charge time by about 5 minutes. This software adjustment that an EV manufacturer may apply is not meant to discourage the use of Superchargers but to adjust to the battery conditions to maintain safety and prolong life.\nSuch close scrutiny may come as a surprise to EV owners. On one occasion a driver had charged his vehicle 245 times at a Supercharger, downloading 6,600kWh of energy. This is unusual because most EV owners use the Level 2 charger at home that takes about five hours for a recharge using about 7kW of power(See BU-1004: Charging an Electric Vehicle)\nBattery temperature also governs how fast a battery can be charged. Figure 4 demonstrates fast-charging as a function of temperature. As milk stays fresh in a refrigerator for a long time, Li-ion also prefers a cool storage temperature, but charging and discharging get best results at an elevated room temperature. At 40°C (104°F), a battery charges in one hour compared to 1.5h at 5°C; however, the packs degrades more quickly than at a moderate 25°C;. At a high 50°C (122°F), however, the charger switches to half-power for safety. Charge power must also be reduced when charging below freezing because low temperature usage leads to anode degradation.\nLi-ion performs best when warm but should be stored at cool temperature. At 40°C (orange),the battery fast-charges in 3,600 second (1h); and 5,400 seconds (1.5h) at 5°C. The charger switches to lower power at 50°C and at freezing temperatures.\nThere are concerns about the impact on the battery on regenerative braking. It has been demonstrated that short recharges during braking do not harm the battery even at low temperatures of 10°C to 0°C (50°F to 32°F).\nCapacity loss is the product of high charge levels and deep discharges, and not the overall charge throughput. Regenerative breaking is beneficial. Supercapacitors to buffer load peaks are not necessary. The power created by regenerative breaking is commonly less than 1C.\nFigure 5 demonstrates capacity fading during cycling at low, medium and high SoC and at different temperatures. These readings are demonstrated in colored solid lines. The graph also illustrates calendar aging that is represented in doted lines with less capacity loss that cycling.\nThe test battery had the highest capacity loss at 10°C (blue) with high SoC, but did well in calendar aging (Figure 5c) when kept cool. Here we have an opposite reactions.\nHigh losses when cycling Li-ion batteries at cool temperatures comes at a surprise. Figure 5c only delivers 500 cycles when cycled at 10°C (50°F) with high SoC. Battery experts hint to lithium plating; cells charged with high currents suffered most. This phenomenon has been confirmed as a dominant aging mechanism affecting the anode. Li-ion should be warmed up to a comfortable temperature of about 25°C (77°F) with operating temperature of up to 40°C (104°F). Interestingly, the lithium plating exhibits some regeneration effects during idle periods.\nFast-charging a Li-ion battery beyond a given charge level causes lithium plating. Lithium is being removed and horded on the anode, creating a shortage that lowers capacity. Studies have shown that the loss of lithium is a major cause of capacity loss that is especially noticeable during fast charging at low temperatures. The lithium is parked in the overhand areas of the anode that has no cathode counterpart.\nThe longer a cell stays at high SoC, the more lithium plating occurs, and the more capacity is lost. But this horded capacity can in part be recovered. A given amount moves back into operation when the cell dwells at low to medium SoC for days and months. The recovery effect is not fully understood and needs further research.\nScientists believe that lithium, which was dislocated into non-active regions and has clogged pores on the anode, can be reinstated during one year of inactivity. The vanished lithium should dissolve again and made active by distribution, but the recovery mechanism is not fully understood and needs further research.\nThere appears to be similarity with the “memory” effect of the nickel-cadmium battery. The crystalline formation that formed when keeping a NiCd on full charge also results in a capacity loss that can be reversed by exercising the battery(See BU-807: How to Restore Nickel-based Batteries)\nIf the hypothesis is correct, rejuvenating a faded Li-ion would also be possible by giving them a rest at a low SoC. This, however, may not be practical because the battery needs to rest for a time. Users of battery-powered devices won’t give their beloved devices a deserved vacation to rejuvenate; however, a recovery will occur without user intervention under the right circumstances. Batteries do indeed reflect human qualities.\nIn addition to capacity fade, battery aging also involves rising internal resistance. Resistance and capacity fade do not correlate. This means that the SoH of a battery cannot be checked effectively by measuring resistance alone. Capacity is the leading health indicator, but capacity is more difficult to check on the fly than resistance.\nFigure 6 illustrates the internal resistance of an 18650 Li-ion NCA cell when cycled at 40ºC (104ºF). Resistance measurements are done with AC and DC methods, two methods that provide different results.\nThe AC method typically uses 1,000 Hertz to measure the impedance and the resulting readings are reflected in the green frame of Figure 6. The numbers stay flat with cycling and do not reflect the true resistive state of a battery relating to delivering power in an EV. DC resistance is the more dependable method and is measured by observing the voltage drop under a load(See also BU-802a: How does Rising Internal Resistance affect Performance?)\nAC resistance readings in green frame stay low; DC method gives true power performance. AC provides impedance while DC reflects true resistance.\nAging characteristics a Li-ion battery are complex and involve charge levels, charging speed, depth of discharge and temperature. Similar to a living organism, longevity is based on a combination of events that takes usage and environmental conditions into account.\nSoC above 80% promotes capacity fade while a deep discharge increases the internal resistance. Li-ion must be shipped at 30% SoC; the recommended long-term storage is between 40–50%. Keeping Li-ion at high SoC affects battery life more than cycling in mid SoC range.\nFuture EVs may adjust battery charging to the user’s routine. Similar to an alarm clock, from Monday to Friday the EV is set in commute mode by only charging the battery to enable driving to work and back. The weekend follows the drive program as entered by an app on the EV owner’s smartphone.\nThe life of a Li-ion battery is prolonged when operating at a mild temperature. The EV battery should be warmed up to a comfortable temperature of around 25°C (77°F) for charging and driving. This is in contrast to storing or parking that should be at 10°C (50°F). Charging and operating Li-ion at low temperature causes stress, a phenomenon that does not apply equally to other chemistries.\nThe combination of low cycle-depth and low SoC leads to the longest battery life, but this does not fully utilize a large, heavy and expensive pack. To avoid resistance increase through deep a discharge, the onboard BMS always keeps some reserve capacity while indicating “empty” wrongly. Reserve capacity also protects the battery when charging at a high current because a completely discharged Li-ion cannot tolerate an ultrafast charge. For best results, charge more often without going full charge.\n[1] Source: Technische Universität München (TUM) Document: Aging of Lithium-Ion Batteries in Electric Vehicles[2] Source: Renault[3] Source: Technische Universität München (TUM) Document: Aging of Lithium-Ion Batteries in Electric Vehicles[4] Source: Technische Universität München (TUM)\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

It seems to note in the graph that low SOC (14%) is the best for storage. Why is the recommendation to store at 40-50%? Also, the resistance graph also shows that deep discharges from a high voltage cause the highest resistance. Why then does the recommendation state: \"Do not discharge the battery too low as this increases the internal resistance\"?? There is no indication of this in the graph.\nExcellent summary of EV and Li-ion batteries in general. Been enjoying this website for over a decade. Look forward to the next update.

        "content": "Batteries operate over a wide temperature range, but this does not give permission to also charge them at these conditions. The charging process is more delicate than discharging and special care must be taken. Extreme cold and high heat reduce charge acceptance and the battery should be brought to a moderate temperature before charging.\nOlder battery technologies, such as lead acid and NiCd, have higher charging tolerances than newer systems, such as Li-ion. This allows them to charge below freezing at a reduced charge C-rate. When it comes to cold-charging NiCd is hardier than NiMH. Lead acid is also tolerant, but Li-ion needs special care.\nTable 1 summarizes the permissible charge and discharge temperatures of common rechargeable batteries. The table excludes specialty batteries that are designed to charge outside these parameters.\nBatteries can be discharged over a large temperature range, but the charge temperature is limited. For best results, charge between 10°C and 30°C (50°F and 86°F). Lower the charge current when cold.\nNickel Based: Fast charging of most batteries is limited to 5°C to 45°C (41°F to 113°F). For best results consider narrowing the temperature bandwidth to between 10°C and 30°C (50°F and 86°F) as the ability to recombine oxygen and hydrogen diminishes when charging nickel-based batteries below 5°C (41°F). If charged too quickly, pressure builds up in the cell that can lead to venting. Reduce the charge current of all nickel-based batteries to 0.1C when charging below freezing.\nNickel-based chargers with NDV (negative delate V) full-charge detection offer some protection when fast charging at low temperatures. Poor charge acceptance when cold mimics a fully charged battery. This is in part caused by a high pressure buildup due to the reduced ability to recombine gases at low temperature. Pressure rise and a voltage drop at full charge appear synonymous.\nTo enable fast charging at all temperatures, some industrial batteries add a thermal blanket that heats the battery to an acceptable temperature; other chargers adjust the charge rate to prevailing temperatures. Consumer chargers do not have these provisions and the end user is advised to only charge at room temperature.\nLead-acid: Lead acid is reasonably forgiving when it comes to temperature extremes, as the starter batteries in our cars reveal. Part of this tolerance is credited to their sluggish behavior. The recommended charge rate at low temperature is 0.3C, which is almost identical to normal conditions. At a comfortable temperature of 20°C (68°F), gassing starts at charge voltage of 2.415V/cell. When going to –20°C (0°F), the gassing threshold rises to 2.97V/cell.\nA lead acid battery charges at a constant current to a set voltage that is typically 2.40V/cell at ambient temperature. This voltage is governed by temperature and is set higher when cold and lower when warm. Figure 2 illustrates the recommended settings for most lead acid batteries. In parallel, the figure also shows the recommended float charge voltage to which the charger reverts when the battery is fully charged. When charging lead acid at fluctuating temperatures, the charger should feature voltage adjustment to minimize stress on the battery. (See also BU-403: Charging Lead Acid)\nFreezing a lead acid battery leads to permanent damage. Always keep the batteries fully charged because in the discharged state the electrolyte becomes more water-like and freezes earlier than when fully charged. According to BCI (Battery Council International), a specific gravity of 1.15 has a freezing temperature of –15°C (5°F). This compares to –55°C (–67°F) for a specific gravity of 1.265 with a fully charged starter battery. Flooded lead acid batteries tend to crack the case and cause leakage if frozen; sealed lead acid packs lose potency and only deliver a few cycles before they fade and need replacement.\nLithium Ion: Li-ion can be fast charged from 5°C to 45°C (41 to 113°F). Below 5°C, the charge current should be reduced, and no charging is permitted at freezing temperatures because of the reduced diffusion rates on the anode. During charge, the internal cell resistance causes a slight temperature rise that compensates for some of the cold. The internal resistance of all batteries rises when cold, prolonging charge times noticeably. This also affects discharge performance noticeably with Li-ion.\nMany battery users are unaware that consumer-grade lithium-ion batteries cannot be charged below 0°C (32°F). Although the pack appears to be charging normally, plating of metallic lithium occurs on the anode during a sub-freezing charge that leads to a permanent degradation in performance and safety. Batteries with lithium plating are more vulnerable to failure if exposed to vibration or other stressful conditions. Advanced chargers (Cadex) prevent charging Li-ion below freezing.\nAdvancements are being made to charge Li-ion below freezing temperatures. Charging is indeed possible with most lithium-ion cells but only at very low currents. According to research papers, the allowable charge rate at –30°C (–22°F) is 0.02C. At this low current, the charge time would stretch to over 50 hours, a time that is deemed impractical. There are, however, specialty Li-ions that can charge down to –10°C (14°F) at a reduced rate.\nSome Li-ion manufacturers offer custom-made cells for cold-charging. Specialty chargers will also be needed that decrease the C-rate according to temperature and charge the battery to a lower voltage peak; 4.00V/cell rather than the customary 4.20V/cell for example. Such limitations decrease the energy a Li-ion battery can hold to roughly 80% instead of the customary 100%. Charge times will also be prolonged and can last 12 hours and longer when cold.\nLi-ion batteries charging below 0°C (32°F) must undergo regulatory issue to certify that no lithium plating will occur. In addition, a specially designed charger will keep the allotted current and voltage within a safe limit throughout the temperature bandwidth. Certification of such batteries and chargers are very costly that will reflect in the price. Similar regulatory requirements also apply to intrinsically safe batteries (See BU-304: Why Are Protection Circuits Needed?)\nThere are cell and charger manufacturers claiming to charge Li-ion at low temperatures; however, most companies do not want to take the risk of potential failure and assume liability. Yes, Li-ion will charge at low temperature but research labs dissecting these batteries see concerning results.\nHeat is the worst enemy of batteries, including lead acid. Adding temperature compensation on a lead acid charger to adjust for temperature variations is said to prolong battery life by up to 15 percent. The recommended compensation is a 3mV drop per cell for every degree Celsius rise in temperature. If the float voltage is set to 2.30V/cell at 25°C (77°F), the voltage should read 2.27V/cell at 35°C (95°F). Going colder, the voltage should be 2.33V/cell at 15°C (59°F). These 10°C adjustments represent 30mV change.\nTable 3 indicates the optimal peak voltage at various temperatures when charging lead acid batteries. The table also includes the recommended float voltage while in standby mode.\nCharging nickel-based batteries at high temperatures lowers oxygen generation, which reduces charge acceptance. Heat fools the charger into thinking that the battery is fully charged when it’s not.\nCharging nickel-based batteries when warm lowers oxygen generation that reduces charge acceptance. Heat fools the charger into thinking that the battery is fully charged when it’s not. Figure 4 shows a strong decrease in charge efficiency from the “100 percent efficiency line” when dwelling above 30°C (86°F). At 45°C (113°F), the battery can only accept 70 percent of its full capacity; at 60°C (140°F) the charge acceptance is reduced to 45 percent. NDV for full-charge detection becomes unreliable at higher temperatures, and temperature sensing is essential for backup.\nHigh temperature reduces charge acceptance and departs from the dotted “100% efficiency line.” At 55°C, commercial NiMH has a charge efficiency of 35–40%; newer industrial NiMH attains 75–80%.\nLithium-ion performs well at elevated temperatures but prolonged exposure to heat reduces longevity. Charging and discharging at elevated temperatures is subject to gas generation that might cause a cylindrical cell to vent and a pouch cell to swell. Many chargers prohibit charging above 50°C (122°F).\nSome lithium-based packs are momentarily heated to high temperatures. This applies to batteries in surgical tools that are sterilized at 137°C (280°F) for up to 20 minutes as part of autoclaving. Oil and gas drilling as part of fracking also exposes the battery to high temperatures.\nCapacity loss at elevated temperature is in direct relationship with state-of-charge (SoC). Figure 5 illustrates the effect of Li-cobalt (LiCoO2) that is first cycled at room temperature (RT) and then heated to 130°C (266°F) for 90 minutes and cycled at 20, 50 and 100 percent SoC. There is no noticeable capacity loss at room temperature. At 130°C with a 20 percent SoC, a slight capacity loss is visible over 10 cycles. This loss is higher with a 50 percent SoC and shows a devastating effect when cycled at full charge.\nTest: LiCoO2/Graphite cells were exposed to 130°C for 90 min.at different SoC between each cycle.\n[1] Source: Betta Batteries[2] Courtesy of Cadex[3] Source: Greatbatch Medical\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

Quality Li-ion cells are not readily available because a reputable battery manufacturer only sells to certified pack assemblers(See BU-305: Building a Lithium-ion Pack) In addition, quality Li-ion cells may only be available in high quantity, leaving smaller service enterprises in a disadvantage.\nWhen repairing a Li-ion pack, make certain that each cell is properly reconnected to a protection circuit(See BU-304: Why are Protection Circuits Needed? and BU-304a: Safety Concerns with Li-ion) With the exception of some single-cell and power-tool packs, all Li-ion batteries must have a protection circuit; lead and nickel-based batteries are exempt.\nLead- and nickel-based batteries are more or less uniform and one can say that lead acid is lead acid and NiMH is NiMH. This cannot be uttered about the lithium-ion family as it has diverged into many unique systems and some with different voltages. While most Li-ion has a nominal cell voltage of 3.60V and charges to 4.20V, some specialty Li-ion charge to 4.10V and newer Energy Cells top at 4.35V/cell and higher. Li-phosphate presents a further exception with a nominal cell voltage of 3.20V and a charge limit of 3.65V/cell. Also unique is Li-titanate with a nominal cell voltage of 2.40V and charge limit of 2.85V(See BU-205: Types of Lithium-ion) These cells are definitely not interchangeable.\nBesides different chemistries, cobalt-based Li-ion is divided into two camps: The Energy Cell provides maximum runtime at moderate load currents and regular charge time; the Power Cell offers high power and some permit shorter charge times(See BU-501: Basics About Discharging) When replacing the cells of a power tool battery, use Power Cells of identical specification to give the pack the same strength and endurance as the previous cell set. Communications devices, cameras and e-bike use the Energy Cell.\nDo not go cheap on the cells and source them from an unrecognized manufacturer. Failing packs often trace to inferior cells, and this also applies with the popular 18650 Li-ion format that come in good and bad qualities. One hears repeatedly of companies that took advantage of marked-down prices from a clearing house, only to have the packs fail after 2–3 years because of high cell failure.\nIf a relatively new pack has only one defective cell and a replacement is located, exchanging the affected cell makes sense. With an aged battery, however, it’s best to replace all cells. Mixing new with old causes a cell mismatch that has a short life. In a well-matched battery pack all cells have similar capacities. An anomaly is a chain in which the weakest link determines the performance of the battery(See BU-302: Serial and Parallel Battery Configurations)\nCells designed for a multi-cell pack require tighter tolerances than those destined for single-cell use, such as a mobile phone. Cell manufacturers cannot fully control the capacity and hence some have higher capacities than others. In a single-cell device the average consumer does not notice such a variance. Quality cells for a multi-cell pack, on the other hand, are capacity-matched, lest they fail.\nA battery shop may salvage good cells from a failed pack for reuse but the recovered cell should be checked for capacity, internal resistance and self-discharge – the three key health indicators of a battery. When checking a cell with a battery analyzer, mark the capacity so it can be matched with a pack that may need a cell of similar capacity level. Also make certain that the internal resistance is in par with a good cell and verify the self-discharge. Electro-mechanical stress often manifests itself in elevated self-discharge. To check self-discharge, fully charge the cell, measure the voltage and compare the voltage after 24 hours and perhaps a week with the voltage drop of known good cells.\nVisitors of BatteryUniversity.com frequently ask: “Can NiCd can be replaced with NiMH?” In theory, this should be possible as both chemistries have the same cell voltage, but full-charge detection and trickle charge are the issues. NiMH uses a more refined charge algorithm than NiCd(See BU-408: Charging Nickel-metal-hydride) A modern NiMH charger can charge both NiMH and NiCd; the old NiCd charger could overcharge NiMH by not properly detecting the full-charge state and applying a trickle charge that is too high. Each chemistry requires its own charger.\nSpot-welding a cell is the only reliable way to get dependable connection and four spot-welds per cell is the norm. Limit the heat transfer to the cells during welding to prevent damage. Insulate each cell electrically as the cell housing is “hot” and carries a voltage. If the new cell is at different charge level than the existing ones, apply a slow charge to bring them all to the same level. Observe the temperature during charge. Nickel-based cells will warm up towards the end of charge but must cool down on ready; Li-ion should stay cool during charge. The rise in temperature should be equal for all cells; unevenness hints to an anomaly.\nMeasure the voltage of a repaired pack and check it again after 24 hours and a few days. If a cell drops lower than another in the pack, then there is fear of elevated self-discharge(See BU-802b: Elevated Self-discharge)\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Lead and cadmium-based batteries pose the largest environmental concerns, so much so that the nickel-cadmium battery was banned in Europe. Efforts are made to also replace the lead-based battery but no suitable replacement is available as was the case by substituting nickel-cadmium with nickel-metal-hydride. For the first time, lithium-ion is added to the list of pollutants. This chemistry was classified as only mildly toxic, but the sheer volume of Li-ion batteries in consumer products requires tighter scrutiny.Rather than discarding batteries, ingenious entrepreneurs discovered a business model to give spent batteries a second life. It began with mobile phones where packs are replaced on the slightest complaint without prior testing. Installing a new battery may not resolve the perceived problem and the boxes under the counter fill with discarded batteries. Mobile phone providers learned that 90 percent of returned warranty batteries can easily be serviced and resold as B-class.Refurbishment centers have sprung up in the USA, UK and Israel, purchasing surplus batteries by the ton and checking them with battery analyzers (Cadex) with a rapid-test function. Reports show that customers using the serviced B-Class batteries have identical performance records to new packs; there are no increases in returns. The Figure 1 shows a box of incoming mobile phone batteries to be serviced.\nWhile a faded battery on a mobile phone device may only cause a mild inconvenience, batteries play a pivotal role in medical devices. As the number of these instruments grows, so does the concern with the battery as it ages. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) rated battery management as one of the top 10 challenges for hospital’s biomedical departments. An US FDA survey says that “up to 50% of issues in hospitals are related to the battery.”A battery has a relatively short service life and must be treated like any other serviceable part in a device that often has a life span of 10 years and longer. When asking users, “At what capacity do you replace the battery?” there is a stare and rolling of eye but no clear answers are given. Without a strategic management plan, batteries are often changed too soon or too late.\nNickel-based batteries offer about three-years of service; Li-ion five. Storage characteristics have also improved with modern lithium-based systems. Under-usage in many industries is common and this leads to discarding large pools of good batteries.Date-stamping has not solved the battery problem but raises a new question. Discarding unchecked batteries escalate cost and harm the environment. Dr. Imre Gyuk, manager of the US Energy Storage Research Program at DOE, says that every year roughly one million usable lithium-ion batteries are sent in for recycling with most having a capacity of up to 80%.More good batteries appear to become available for refurbishing. Although less than 100 percent in capacity, rugged industrial batteries have plenty of life left to serve less demanding applications. GM and ABB are already using Chevrolet Volt battery packs to store electrical energy for grid use. A medical technician working in a large Michigan hospital uses spent batteries from patient heart pumps to cut his grass with an electric lawn mower. This makes green energy even greener. The leading health indicator of a battery is capacity; it determines how much energy a pack can hold. The measured capacity also suggests the price a refurbished battery can fetch. Eighty to one hundred percent is considered good; batteries for critical applications are often replaced when the capacity falls below 80 percent. This does not mean that the battery can no longer be deployed for less demanding applications but it should have a capacity of at least 50 to 60- percent to make refurbishing worthwhile. Below 50 percent the capacity may drop rapidly when in use and exhibit other problems.The Capacity also plays an important role when matching cells and mono-blocks as part of assembling a new battery pack. The closer the match, the better the restored battery will perform and the longer the life will be. Packs designed for heavy loads and wide adverse temperature ranges are normally marched to +/– 2.5 percent. Such a tight tolerance may not be possible with refurbished cells and mono-blocks.The capacity of Li-ion batteries cannot be increased when low as it is possible with nickel-based batteries. Some argue a small capacity gain when exercising Li-ion after a long storage, but gains are anecdotal. Li-ion has no memory effect that can be reversed.\nThe ready light on the charger does not mean “able;” it only says that the battery is fully charged. Faded batteries charge quicker than good packs and are picked in error as being combat ready. The fuel gauge on a pack is not the answer either. It always shows 100% after each charge even if the capacity has dropped in half. A fuel gauge cannot estimate capacity.Several battery rapid-test methods have emerged, but capacity estimation is difficult as no instrument can estimate the state-of-health of a battery in a single measurement. Similar to a doctor examining a patient, or the weatherman forecasting the weather, battery testing involves looking at multiple attributes to get a clear health assessment based on measurable symptoms. Reading the internal resistance of a battery no longer provides reliable indication of battery performance. The modern Li-ion has improved and keeps low resistance with cycling and aging. Figure 2 illustrates the typical relationship as a function of number of cycles. The capacity drops predictably with cycling and the internal resistance tends to stay low.Figure 2: Relationship between capacity and resistance as part of cyclingThe resistance of modern Lithium-ion remains low while the capacity gradually drops. Resistance measurements alone do not provide reliable results.\nCadex recommends battery analyzers to first establish if a battery is functional or not. Most Cadex analyzers feature the Custom program that can be configured to run a short test to examine voltage, internal resistance and if the battery can take a charge and deliver a discharge thereafter.To test a unknown battery, the user enters the battery chemistry, voltage and Ah rating. The test begins with a brief discharge, followed by a short charge and a repeat discharge to verify the ability to hold a charge. Included in the test is also a battery resistance check that is repeated at the end of each cycle. The user can observe the battery behavior on the monitor during the test with the PC-BatteryShop™ software and abort the test if the battery does not react normally.The battery is considered functional if the voltage stays within a defined window. Stepping outside the boundary denotes a fail. Typical test time is three minutes; a fail-condition would be known in seconds. The functional batteries should then undergo a full service before deploying the battery in service as the final capacity reading must always be known. A full cycle also calibrates “smart” batteries with fuel gauges. This method works for Li-ion, nickel-based as well as deep-cycle lead acid batteries.Figure 3 illustrates the C7400ER, a programmable battery analyzer featuring the Custom program and servicing lead, nickel- and lithium-based batteries with ratings of up to 36V and 6A per channel to accommodate sizes of up to 24Ah. Each of the four stations operates independently. Redundant test algorithms assure safe service of batteries with a known fault.\nConnecting batteries has always been a challenge and Cadex solved this with battery adapters. Frequently used batteries are best serviced with a custom adapter. The Smart Cable is best suited for a broad range of larger batteries that sit outside the battery well, and the RigidArm is most convenient for mobile phone batteries. Spring-loaded arms meet the battery contacts from the top down, allowing quick and repetitive testing. The retractable floor holds the battery in a vertical position and a temperature sensor monitors the battery during the test.\nSpent batteries are increasingly being refurbished and given a new lease of life, and for good reasons. Batteries have often much life left upon a retirement that has come too early.Battery recycles are also becoming aware of the growing numbers of good batteries that are being discarded by rigid replacement policies, such as date-stamping. When it comes to healthcare, defense and other critical operations, few clerks will ask questions. They follow a dictated order without first testing the battery. The result is high operating cost and a strain on the environment.The battery refurbishing market is expected to grow as more devices are fitted with batteries. One of the most promising industries is the electric car. Battery testing and reassembly is relatively simple but the key to success is identifying packs that still have good life left and then perform a complete test that includes capacity, self-discharge, internal resistance and voltage. Rapid-testing may work for mobile phone batteries but it is not recommended for larger packs. Only a full cycle will reveal full battery characteristics, which can be provided to the buyer as proof of performance.\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-305-building-a-lithium-ion-pack",
        "content": "Building a Li-ion battery pack begins by satisfying voltage and runtime requirements, and then taking loading, environmental, size and weight limitations into account. Portable designs for consumer products want a slim profile and the choice is a prismatic or pouch cell. If space allows, a cylindrical cell such as the 18650 often provides the lowest cost and best performance in terms of specific energy, safety and durability. (See BU-301a: Types of Battery Cells)\nMost battery packs for medical devices, power tools, e-bikes and even powertrains for electric cars (EV) are based on the 18650. This appears impractical but the small cell works well because it is one of the most mature Li-ion formats available, is produced in high volume and enjoys a low cost per Wh.\nThe cylindrical cell is not ideal as it leaves empty spaces in a mul\nti-cell configuration. This disadvantage turns into an advantage when considering flexibility and cooling. The Tesla S85 EV uses over 7,000 cells, switched in parallel to boost the current and in series to increase the voltage. Should one cell in series open, the total power loss is minimal; if one in parallel shorts, fuse protection removes this cell from the circuit. Failing cells can thus be eliminated without bringing the battery down.\nEV manufacturers are not united on the choice of cell, but there is a trend towards larger formats to reduce supportive electronics that adds 20–25 percent to the finished pack. With a larger cell, however, the electronic components get dearer because of higher current handling. According to 2015 reports, the Tesla S 85 has the lowest cost per kWh using the 18650. Other EVs have larger prismatic cells at higher kWh costs. Table 1 compares the kWh cost.\n* In 2015/16 Tesla S 85 increased the battery from 85kWh to 90kWh; Nissan Leaf from 25kWh to 30kWh.\nBatteries should be designed to permit failure without a catastrophic event. All energy sources will fail eventually and the battery is no exception. After an unwanted event, the FAA mandated to place the Li-ion ship-battery of the Boeing Dreamliner 787 into a metal container with venting to the outside. Tesla reinforced the EV battery by adding a heavy-gauge steel plate on the bottom that provides extra protection against projectiles from the road.\nLarge batteries for power applications are cooled. Some use a rod system to bring the heat to the outside, others deploy forced air or use liquid cooling. Liquid cooling is superior and although more expensive, EV batteries gravitate towards this form of cooling.\nReputable battery manufacturers do not supply Li-ion cells to uncertified battery assemblers. This precaution is understandable, considering that Li-ion cells could be charged and discharged beyond safe limits with inadequate protection circuits.\nAuthorizing a battery pack for the commercial market and for air transport can cost $10,000 to $20,000. Such a high price is troubling, knowing that cell manufacturers discontinue older cells in favor of higher capacity replacements. A pack with the new cell, even if specified as a direct replacement, requires new certifications.\nThe common question asked is, “Why are additional tests needed when the cells are already approved?” The simple answer is that cell approvals cannot be transferred to the pack because regulatory authorities place the safety confirmation on a finished product and not the components. The completed battery must be tested and registered to assure correct assembly and compliance with safety standards.\nAs part of the test requirements, the finished battery must undergo electrical and mechanical assessment to meet the Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods on lithium-ion batteries for air shipment, rules set by the United Nations (UN). The UN Transportation Testing (UN/DOT 38.3) works in conjunction with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US Department of Transport (US DOT) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA)*. The certification applies to primary and secondary lithium-based cells.\nThe UN 38.3 test includes:\nThe test batteries must pass the tests without causing harm, but the packs do not need to function thereafter. The test is strictly for safety and not consumer endurance. The authorized laboratory needs 24 battery samples consisting of 12 new packs and 12 specimens that have been cycled 50 times. IATA wants to ensure that the batteries in question are airworthy and have field integrity; cycling the packs 50 times before the test satisfies this requirement.\nThe high certification cost discourages small manufacturers from using Li-ion for low-volume products and entrepreneurs may choose nickel-based systems instead. These batteries do not need to be tested to the level of lithium-based products for air transport. While reputable companies follow the instructions, rules are being broken and the penalties are stiff. ( See BU-704: How to Transport Batteries)\n* IATA (International Air Transport Association) works with airlines and the air transport industry to promote safe, reliable, secure and economical air travel.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-404-what-is-equalizing-charge",
        "content": "Stationary batteries are almost exclusively lead acid and some maintenance is required, one of which is equalizing charge. Applying a periodic equalizing charge brings all cells to similar levels by increasing the voltage to 2.50V/cell, or 10 percent higher than the recommended charge voltage.\nAn equalizing charge is nothing more than a deliberate overcharge to remove sulfate crystals that build up on the plates over time. Left unchecked, sulfation can reduce the overall capacity of the battery and render the battery unserviceable in extreme cases. An equalizing charge also reverses acid stratification, a condition where acid concentration is greater at the bottom of the battery than at the top.\nExperts recommend equalizing services once a month to once or twice a year. A better method is to apply a fully saturated charge and then compare the specific gravity readings (SG) on the individual cells of a flooded lead acid battery with a hydrometer. Only apply equalization if the SG difference between the cells is 0.030.\nDuring equalizing charge, check the changes in the SG reading every hour and disconnect the charge when the gravity no longer rises. This is the time when no further improvement is possible and a continued charge would have a negative effect on the battery.\nThe battery must be kept cool and under close observation for unusual heat rise and excessive venting. Some venting is normal and the hydrogen emitted is highly flammable. The battery room must have good ventilation as the hydrogen gas becomes explosive at a concentration of 4 percent.\nEqualizing VRLA and other sealed batteries involves guesswork. Observing the differences in cell voltage does not give a conclusive solution and good judgment plays a pivotal role when estimating the frequency and duration of the service. Some manufacturers recommend monthly equalizations for 2–16 hours. Most VRLAs vent at 34kPa (5psi), and repeated venting leads to the depletion of the electrolyte, which can lead to a dry-out condition.\nNot all chargers feature equalizing charge. If not available, the service should be performed with a dedicated device.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

I have 3.5KW load. In start it gives me 3 hour backup but later it only gives 45 minutes. I checked the voltage of the batteries and only the last battery in series have low voltage.\nthen someone told me to replace the batteries with Tall Tublar Batteries(225A) . 2 months ago I changed them and it gives me upto 5 hr backup.\nNow I am facing same issue as the last battery have low voltage after 1 hr.\nGood day all. \n   I’m trying to find a good charger that is designed to equalize the cells of my 6V batteries. I fully understand the the Rory of it all but can’t find a good charger. I bought an obviously poor quality fully adjustable power supply but it only lasted an hour before failing. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. \nMick.\nSirs, \nI had 2 x 12v x 200 Ah batteries was used on a UPS for 7 or 8 months,  they were giving me 8 hours of load @ 220 AC& 3 A . I installed solar panels (6) with controller (48v) now I'm using the 2 old batteries with 2 new batteries in series (48v).\nI noticed that the new batteries charging up to 15v & the 2 old batteries charging only at 13.4 v. Is there's a way to equalize the batteries & bring the 7 month old batteries to the voltage level of the new ones?  & how?  Please advice.\nSirs, \nI had 2 x 12v x 200 Ah batteries was used on a UPS for 7 or 8 months,  they were giving me 8 hours of load @ 220 AC& 3 A .

Please advice.\nI'm no expert, but as I understand it the battery gets fully charged first - so the final trickle at high voltage is what equalizing does. My Noco smart charger does it at 1500mA - 1.5 amps. Basically it cooks he sulfate off the lead plates for 2-4  hours. I've heard of people equalizing for a couple of days - I don't know if I would do that. Maybe 8 hours, then I would give up and get new batteries. LOL\nHi, Could you tell me how many amps I should equalize a pair of Trojan 6V T105 flooded batteries at? I understand the equalize voltage to be 8.10v for one 6v battery and 16.2v for two batteries in series (12v) (according to the Trojan datasheet) not sure what amps is preferable though? some sources are saying 10/15% of battery 225AH rating, others are saying at least 25% of the 225AH Many thanks!\nComments from the previous website are not compatible with our new commenting system but we have preserved them so our users can still reference and make use the information in them.\nThe material on Battery University is based on the indispensable new 4th edition of \"Batteries in a Portable World - A Handbook on Rechargeable Batteries for Non-Engineers\" which is available for order through Amazon.com.\nBuy On Amazon"

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-809-how-to-maximize-runtime",
        "content": "As the author of Battery University, I get many interesting inquiries from battery users. One battery user writes, “Hi, I am looking for an answer to a perplexing question. A co-worker and I have identical mobile phones from the same provider. Moving into a new house, she complained that her battery life has shortened. I told her she was out of her mind, but then I noticed my battery behaving differently when I travel. Is there some mysterious force that’s draining the battery?”\nYes, there is a hidden force that drains the battery, but it’s not mystical. In standby mode, a mobile phone is in constant communication with the tower, transmitting small bursts of power every second or so to check for incoming calls. To save energy, the transmit power adjusts according to signal strength. Being close to a repeater tower lowers the power; moving away or entering an area with high electrical noise, such as a shopping mall, hospital or factory, boosts the power. An analogy is having to raise your voice in a noisy restaurant.\nLiving in sight of a tower has advantages and your battery will run longer between charges. Where you park your mobile phone in the house also affects runtime. A manager of a large cellular provider in the UK said that his son experienced shorter standby times after moving from the upstairs bedroom to the basement. If possible, leave your mobile phone in an upstairs room facing a tower. When traveling by car, place the phone near a window rather than on the floor, but avoid direct exposure to the sun.\nSimilar rules apply to TETRA and P25 radio systems, cordless telephones, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices. A wireless headset communicating with the cell phone from belt to ear provides longer runtimes than when placing the handset on the dining-room table while cooking in the kitchen. Although the quality of communication does not change, the Bluetooth headset needs to work harder when placed farther away from the user.\nWhen the mobile phone is “off,” the load on the battery is very low and only provides power for housekeeping to maintain the clock and monitor low-level commands. These consumptions, including self-discharge, amount to 5–10 percent of the available battery energy per month.\nLaptop batteries fare badly in terms of life span. Laptops are demanding bosses that request a steady stream of power under poor working conditions, toiling in a warm climate. In addition, the battery is exposed to a high charge voltage when connected to the AC main. Warm temperature and full state-of-charge are the cause of short battery life in laptops, not cycling.\nModern laptops run cooler, so do tablets and smartphones. Circuits have become more efficient and the battery capacity is increasing but these improvements are being offset by added features. The two major gas-guzzlers are the display and the transmitter. Data transfer consumes about twice the energy to simply talking on the phone.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-1005-does-the-fuel-cell-powered-vehicle-have-a-future",
        "content": "The fuel cell as a propulsion system is in many ways superior to a battery because it needs to carry less energy storage by weight and volume compared to a vehicle propelled by batteries only. Figure 1 illustrates the practical driving range of a vehicle powered by a fuel cell (FC) compared to lead acid, NiMH and Li-ion batteries(Also see BU-210: How does the fuel Cell work?)\nThe logarithmical curves of battery power place limitations in size and weight. The FC has a linear progression and is similar to the ICE vehicle.\nNote: 35MPa hydrogen tank refers to 5,000psi pressure; 70MPa is 10,000psi.\nOne can clearly see that batteries simply get too heavy when increasing the size to enable greater distances. In this respect, the fuel cell enjoys similar qualities to the internal combustion engine (ICE) in that it can conquer great distances with only the addition of extra fuel.\nThe weight of fuel is most critical in air transport. Airlines only carry sufficient fuel to safely reach their designation, knowing that the airplane becomes more fuel efficient towards the end of the journey as the weight eases. A study group calculated that if the kerosene in an aircraft were replaced with batteries, the flight would last less than 10 minutes.\nAlthough the fuel cell assumes the duty of the ICE in a vehicle, poor response time and a weak power band make on-board batteries necessary. In this respect, the FC car resembles an electric vehicle with an on-board charger that keeps the batteries charged. This results in short cycles that reduces battery stress over the EV; a propulsion system that bears a resemblance to the HEV.\nThe FC of a mid-sized car generates around 85kW (114hp) to charge the 18kWh on-board battery and drive the electric motor. On start-up, the vehicle relies fully on the battery; the fuel cell only contributes after reaching a steady state in 5–30 seconds. During the warm-up period, the battery must also deliver power to activate the air compressor and pumps. Once warm, the FC provides enough power for cruising; however, during acceleration, passing and hill-climbing both the FC and battery provide throttle power. Braking delivers kinetic energy to the battery.\nHydrogen costs about twice as much as gasoline, but the higher efficiency of the FC compared to the ICE in converting fuel to energy bring both systems on par. The FC has the added benefit of producing less greenhouse gas than the ICE.\nHydrogen is commonly derived from natural gas. Folks might ask, “Why not burn natural gas directly in the ICE instead of converting it to hydrogen through a reformer and then transforming it to electricity in a fuel cell to feed the electric motors?” The answer is efficiency. Burning natural gas in a combustion turbine to produce electricity has an efficiency factor of only 26–32 percent while a fuel cell is 35–50 percent efficient. That said, the machinery required to support the FC is costlier and requires more maintenance than a simple burning process.\nTo complicate matters further, building a hydrogen infrastructure is expensive. A refueling station capable of reforming natural gas to hydrogen to support 2,300 vehicles costs over $2 million, or $870 per vehicle. In comparison, a Level 2 charging outlet to charge EVs can easily be installed by connecting to the existing electric grid. The benefit with FC is a quick refill similar to filling a tank with liquid fuel.\nDurability and cost are further deterrents for the FC, but improvements are made. The service life of an FC-powered car has doubled from 1,000 hours to 2,000 hours. The target for 2015 is 5,000 hours, or a vehicle life of 240,000km (150,000 miles).\nA further challenge is vehicle cost as the fuel cell is more expensive to build than an ICE. As a guideline, an FC vehicle is more expensive than a plug-in hybrid, and the plug-in hybrid is dearer than a gasoline-powered car. With low fuel prices, alternative propulsion systems are difficult to justify on cost alone and the environmental benefits must be considered. Japan is making renewed efforts with FC propulsion to offer an alternative to the ICE and the EV. Toyota plans to phase out the ICE by 2050 and other vehicle makers are observing the trend.\n[1] Source: International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 34, 6005-6020 (2009)+\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "The lead acid battery uses the constant current constant voltage (CCCV) charge method. A regulated current raises the terminal voltage until the upper charge voltage limit is reached, at which point the current drops due to saturation. The charge time is 12–16 hours and up to 36–48 hours for large stationary batteries. With higher charge currents and multi-stage charge methods, the charge time can be reduced to 8–10 hours; however, without full topping charge. Lead acid is sluggish and cannot be charged as quickly as other battery systems. (See BU-202: New Lead Acid Systems)\nWith the CCCV method, lead acid batteries are charged in three stages, which are [1] constant-current charge, [2] topping charge and [3] float charge. The constant-current charge applies the bulk of the charge and takes up roughly half of the required charge time; the topping charge continues at a lower charge current and provides saturation, and the float charge compensates for the loss caused by self-discharge.\nDuring the constant-current charge, the battery charges to about 70 percent in 5–8 hours; the remaining 30 percent is filled with the slower topping charge that lasts another 7–10 hours. The topping charge is essential for the well-being of the battery and can be compared to a little rest after a good meal. If continually deprived, the battery will eventually lose the ability to accept a full charge and the performance will decrease due to sulfation. The float charge in the third stage maintains the battery at full charge. Figure 1 illustrates these three stages.\nThe battery is fully charged when the current drops to a set low level. The float voltage is reduced. Float charge compensates for self-discharge that all batteries exhibit.\nThe switch from Stage 1 to 2 occurs seamlessly and happens when the battery reaches the set voltage limit. The current begins to drop as the battery starts to saturate; full charge is reached when the current decreases to 3–5 percent of the Ah rating. A battery with high leakage may never attain this low saturation current, and a plateau timer takes over to end the charge.\nThe correct setting of the charge voltage limit is critical and ranges from 2.30V to 2.45V per cell. Setting the voltage threshold is a compromise and battery experts refer to this as “dancing on the head of a pin.” On one hand, the battery wants to be fully charged to get maximum capacity and avoid sulfation on the negative plate; on the other hand, over-saturation by not switching to float charge causes grid corrosion on the positive plate. This also leads to gassing and water-loss.\nTemperature changes the voltage and this makes “dancing on the head of a pin” more difficult. A warmer ambient requires a slightly lower voltage threshold and a colder temperature prefers a higher setting. Chargers exposed to temperature fluctuations include temperature sensors to adjust the charge voltage for optimum charge efficiency. (See BU-410: Charging at High and Low Temperatures )\nThe charge temperature coefficient of a lead acid cell is –3mV/°C. Establishing 25°C (77°F) as the midpoint, the charge voltage should be reduced by 3mV per cell for every degree above 25°C and increased by 3mV per cell for every degree below 25°C. If this is not possible, it is better to choose a lower voltage for safety reasons. Table 2 compares the advantages and limitations of various peak voltage settings.\nOnce fully charged through saturation, the battery should not dwell at the topping voltage for more than 48 hours and must be reduced to the float voltage level. This is especially critical for sealed systems because they are less tolerant to overcharge than the flooded type. Charging beyond the specified limits turns redundant energy into heat and the battery begins to gas.\nThe recommended float voltage of most flooded lead acid batteries is 2.25V to 2.27V/cell. Large stationary batteries at 25°C (77°F) typically float at 2.25V/cell. Manufacturers recommend lowering the float charge when the ambient temperature rises above 29°C (85°F).\nFigure 3 illustrate the life of a lead acid battery that is kept at a float voltage of 2.25V to 2.30V/cell and at a temperature of 20°C to 25°C (60°F to 77°F). After 4 years of operation permanent capacity losses become visible, crossing the 80 percent line. This loss is larger if the battery requires periodic deep discharges. Elevated heat also reduces battery life. (See also BU-806a: How Heat and Loading affect Battery Life)\nNot all chargers feature float charge and very few road vehicles have this provision. If your charger stays on topping charge and does not drop below 2.30V/cell, remove the charge after 48 hours of charging. Recharge every 6 months while in storage; AGM every 6–12 months.\nThese described voltage settings apply to flooded cells and batteries with a pressure relief valve of about 34kPa (5psi). Cylindrical sealed lead acid, such as the Hawker Cyclon cell, requires higher voltage settings and the limits should be set to manufacturer’s specifications. Failing to apply the recommended voltage will cause a gradual decrease in capacity due to sulfation. The Hawker Cyclon cell has a pressure relief setting of 345kPa (50psi). This allows some recombination of the gases generated during charge.\nAging batteries pose a challenge when setting the float charge voltage because each cell has its own unique condition. Connected in a string, all cells receive the same charge current and controlling individual cell voltages as each reaches full capacity is almost impossible. Weak cells may go into overcharge while strong cells remain in a starved state. A float current that is too high for the faded cell might sulfate the strong neighbor due to undercharge. Cell-balancing devices are available compensate for the differences in voltages caused by cell imbalance.\nRipple voltage also causes a problem with large stationary batteries. A voltage peak constitutes an overcharge, causing hydrogen evolution, while the valley induces a brief discharge that creates a starved state resulting in electrolyte depletion. Manufacturers limit the ripple on the charge voltage to 5 percent.\nMuch has been said about pulse charging of lead acid batteries to reduce sulfation. The results are inconclusive and manufacturers as well as service technicians are divided on the benefit. If sulfation could be measured and the right amount of pulsing applied, then the remedy could be beneficial; however giving a cure without knowing the underlying side effects can be harmful to the battery.\nMost stationary batteries are kept on float charge and this works reasonably well. Another method is the hysteresis charge that disconnects the float current when the battery goes to standby mode. The battery is essentially put in storage and is only “borrowed” from time to time to apply a topping-charge to replenish lost energy due to self-discharge, or when a load is applied. This mode works well for installations that do not draw a load when on standby.\nLead acid batteries must always be stored in a charged state. A topping charge should be applied every 6 months to prevent the voltage from dropping below 2.05V/cell and causing the battery to sulfate. With AGM, these requirements can be relaxed.\nMeasuring the open circuit voltage (OCV) while in storage provides a reliable indication as to the state-of-charge of the battery. A cell voltage of 2.10V at room temperature reveals a charge of about 90 percent. Such a battery is in good condition and needs only a brief full charge prior to use. (See also BU-903: How to Measure State-of-charge)\nObserve the storage temperature when measuring the open circuit voltage. A cool battery lowers the voltage slightly and a warm one increases it. Using OCV to estimate state-of-charge works best when the battery has rested for a few hours, because a charge or discharge agitates the battery and distorts the voltage.\nSome buyers do not accept shipments of new batteries if the OCV at incoming inspection is below 2.10V per cell. A low voltage suggests a partial charge due to long storage or a high self-discharge caused by a micro-short. Battery users have found that a pack arriving at a lower than specified voltage has a higher failure rate than those with higher voltages. Although in-house service can often bring such batteries to full performance, the time and equipment required adds to operational costs. (Note that the 2.10V/cell acceptance threshold does not apply to all lead acid types equally.)\nUnder the right temperature and with sufficient charge current, lead acid provides high charge efficiently. The exception is charging at 40°C (104°F) and low current, as Figure 4 demonstrates. In respect of high efficiency, lead acid shares this fine attribute with Li-ion that is closer to 99%. See BU-409: Charging Lithium-ion and BU-808b: What Causes Li-ion to Die?\nManufacturers recommend a charge C-rate of 0.3C, but lead acid can be charged at a higher rate up to 80% state-of-charge (SoC) without creating oxygen and water depletion. Oxygen is only generated when the battery is overcharged. The 3-stage CCCV charger prevents this from happening by limiting the charge voltage to 2.40V/cell (14.40V with 6 cells) and then lowering to a float charge about 2.30V/cell (13.8V with 6 cells) at full-charge. These are voltages below the gassing stage.\nTest show that a heathy lead acid battery can be charged at up to 1.5C as long as the current is moderated towards a full charge when the battery reaches about 2.3V/cell (14.0V with 6 cells). Charge acceptance is highest when SoC is low and diminishes as the battery fills. Battery state-of-health and temperature also play an important role when fast-charging. Make certain that the battery does not “boil” or heat up during charge. Put an eye on the battery when charging above the manufacturer’s recommended C-rate.\nWatering is the single most important step in maintaining a flooded lead acid battery; a requirement that is all too often neglected. The frequency of watering depends on usage, charge method and operating temperature. Over-charging also leads to water consumption.\nA new battery should be checked every few weeks to estimate the watering requirement. This assures that the top of the plates are never exposed. A naked plate will sustain irreversible damage through oxidation, leading to reduced capacity and lower performance.\nIf low on electrolyte, immediately fill the battery with distilled or de-ionized water. Tap water may be acceptable in some regions. Do not fill to the correct level before charging as this could cause an overflow during charging. Always top up to the desired level after charging. Never add electrolyte as this would upset the specific gravity and promote corrosion. Watering systems eliminate low electrolyte levels by automatically adding the right amount of water.\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex[2] Source: Power-Sonic\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-605-calibrating-smart-batteries-with-impedance-tracking",
        "content": "When Gaston Planté invented the rechargeable battery in 1859, a new system of store energy emerged. The digital world has been intruding to make the electrochemical battery smart by adding a see-through window to removing its opaqueness and reveal state-of-function.\nThe smart battery was hailed as an engineering marvel when introduced in 1994 by Intel and Duracell. The heart is the system management bus, or SMBus, that tracks state-of-charge (SoC) and captures performance data. SMBus also incorporates the battery management system (BMS) to assure safe operation of Li-ion batteries by limiting over-voltage and preventing high current draws.\nUnlike a regular battery in which the charger is in command, the smart battery becomes the host that controls charge functions in a Level 2 charger. Being the master enables charging future battery chemistries for which no charge algorithm currently exists. Level 3 is a hybrid charger that accommodates batteries with SMBus as well as regular batteries. This is the preferred system as the charger takes control should SMBus communication fail. Level 1 chargers only supports single chemistry and has been discontinued.\nTo maintain SoC accuracy, a smart battery requires periodic calibration. If calibration is not available, the device manufacturer advises to occasionally apply a full discharge in the device. This resets the discharge flag, followed by the charge flag when full charge as illustrated in Figure 1. Calibration thus establishes a linear line between full and empty to measure SoC.\nIn time the line blurs again and a recalibration is needed. Device manufacturers advise to calibrate smart batteries every three months or after 40 partial discharges. Calibration error is recorded by the Max Error metric. A number 1 reflects a well-calibrated battery; higher figures indicate the need for service.\nA charge-discharge-charge calibration cycle as shown in Figure 1 does not correct loss of capacity. Even though the SoC gauge shows 100%, a fully charged battery with a usable capacity of 50% will only deliver half the specified runtime. As the battery fades, the energy storage capability shrinks that Figure 2 simulates by adding rocks.\nA battery must also have low internal resistance (Ri) to deliver power. Although capacity-loss and rising Ri do not correlate, the anticipated runtime can only be delivered if Ri is within specifications. Capacity is the leading health indicator, a value that in most cases governs the end-of-life when dropping below 80%. An elevated rise in Ri as part of cycling and aging is less common.\nThe modern smart battery also reveals the usable capacity shown in Full Charge Capacity (FCC). When new, a smart battery’s FCC is equal to the design capacity of 100%. However, as the battery fades the percentage of usable capacity decreases. FCC can be read with a Smart Bus Reader reflecting the battery’s “digital capacity.”\nHow well does the usable capacity track with FCC? Cadex labs discovered an accuracy discrepancy of greater than 5% on one-third of random smart batteries tested. This explains why users experience sudden blackouts when moments before the battery showed 20% SoC. In spite of these anomalies, the smart battery provides valuable information; frequent calibration upholds accuracies.\nThe usable capacity on a modern smart battery is made readable with Impedance Tracking. Batteries with Impedance Tracking count in-and-outflowing coulombs* during charge and discharge. An analogy is a glass holding a liquid content of 20% that is filled to 100% while measuring the inflowing energy. Residual capacity plus added charge discloses the usable capacity as demonstrated in Figure 3.\nCapacity estimation by Impedance Tracking requires assessing the remaining charge (old fill) before charge. The smart battery does this by measuring the open circuit voltage (OCV), a value that is compared against a reference curve matching the battery chemistry.\nBecause of agitation after a charge and discharge, rest periods are needed to reach voltage equilibrium to enable SoC estimations. As an example, after-charge needs a minimal rest of two hours; after-discharge requires a five-hour rest. The system also adds temperature compensation as cold and heat affect the cell voltage.\nDespite these precautions, FCC loses accuracy. Calibration of a smart battery with Impedance Tracking needs rest periods, a service that is best done with a battery analyzer. This so-called formal calibration also resets the Max Error, a function that a full cycle alone will not provide. Testing batteries on an analyzer also displays the real usable capacity with Ri to verify SoH.\nAll batteries should be serviced with a battery analyzer before replacement. Some smart batteries fail due to digital defect that the analyzer may correct. For best result, calibration should be repeated as certain type of smart batteries only correct the reading by a limited percentage point.\n* One coulomb is equal to the amount of charge delivered by 1A of current in one second\nThe BMS in an electric vehicle (EV) works similarly to a smart battery, but here the driver is relieved of calibration. We ask: “Why does my smart battery need calibration while the EV goes free?” The answer lies in self-calibration that applies to both EV and smart batteries featuring Impedance Tracking.\nSelf-calibration sets SoC Orientation Points (SoC-OP) as shown in Figure 4. This occurs when a battery reaches equilibrium after a charge or discharge. Adding or subtracting coulombs between these points enables assessing the energy storage capacity and making adjustments as the battery fades as part of self-calibration. Best results are achieved when the SoC-OPs are spaced far apart. Each BMS has its own mechanism that is not disclosed.\nA low SoC-OP typically occurs at the end of the day or after a deliberate full discharge. Adding a delay before charge provides the required rest period to solidify the low SoC-OP; a rest after a full charge sets the high SoC-OP to complete self-calibration. User patterns that occur naturally during normal use can be manipulated to improve self-calibration by a thoughtful battery user.\nEV batteries use a similar principle, a method that can also be improved with clever timing between use and charge by the vehicle owner. Because of the flat discharge curve of a Li-ion battery in mid-SoC range, the best SoC-OP locations are below 30% and above 70% SoC. The LiFePO (LFP) in the lithium battery family has a very flat midrange curve, but the more popular NMC has a measurable mid-charge tilt. Knowing these characteristics, an EV battery can be calibrated without tools by following this procedure:\nCalibration can improve range prediction by up to 80km (50 miles). To get full benefit, the service may need to be repeated. Some service centers provide calibration for given EVs but this is expensive and time-consuming. Battery calibration is recommended once or twice a year and when buying a used EV.\nBatteries in Energy Storage Systems (ESS) share similarities with the EV battery in that the battery system contains modules of serial and parallel-connected cells managed by a BMS. Most ESS’s are monitored by observing cell voltage, load current and temperature. Voltage and current measurements enable SoC and Ri readings, but capacity assessment to determine the end-of-life on capacity is unattainable. Some ESS include Artificial Neural Networking as described in Advancements in Battery Testing by “massaging” big data to assess SoH. Self-calibration with Impedance Tracking can also be used for ESS applications.\nSMBus is not the only communications for a smart battery. The Controller Area Network (CAN Bus) is a vehicle bus standard that allows the battery to communicate with a host system. Developed by Robert Bosch in 1983, the CAN Bus is primarily used in hybrid vehicles, including e-bikes, drones and robots.\nWith thousands of cells connected in series and parallel, a cell imbalance can occur in time. The best cell balancing happens at the battery assembly plant by using quality cells that are tightly matched in capacity. Cell balancing is not as effective as calibration because weak cells remain weak, even after being fully charged. Cell balancing does not correct a battery pack in the same way as calibration does.\nThe modern smart battery self-calibrates when given the opportunity during charge or undisturbed discharge. Sufficient rest time must be given to establish equilibrium, an event that forms the SoC-Ops in a battery with Impedance Tracking. The best results are achieved when applying formal calibration with specified rest periods on a battery analyzer. Periodic calibration is also recommended for the EV.\nThe smart battery is indeed smart, but left unattended, the reading can get off by as much as 30%. Unless regularly calibrated, SoC and FCC data of portable batteries should be taken as reference readings only.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-401-how-do-battery-chargers-work",
        "content": "A good battery charger provides the base for batteries that are durable and perform well. In a price-sensitive market, chargers often receive low priority and get the “after-thought” status. Battery and charger must go together like a horse and carriage. Prudent planning gives the power source top priority by placing it at the beginning of the project rather than after the hardware is completed, as is a common practice. Engineers are often unaware of the complexity involving the power source, especially when charging under adverse conditions.\nChargers are commonly identified by their charging speed. Consumer products come with a low-cost personal charger that performs well when used as directed. The industrial charger is often made by a third party and includes special features, such as charging at adverse temperatures. Although batteries operate below freezing, not all chemistries can be charged when cold and most Li-ions fall into this category. Lead- and nickel-based batteries accept charge when cold but at a lower rate. (See BU-410: Charging at High and Low Temperature)\nSome Li-ion chargers (Cadex) include a wake-up feature, or “boost,” to allow recharging if a Li-ion battery has fallen asleep due to over-discharge. A sleep condition can occur when storing the battery in a discharged state in which self-discharge brings the voltage to the cut-off point. A regular charger treats such a battery as unserviceable and the pack is often discarded. Boost applies a small charge current to raise the voltage to between 2.2V/cell and 2.9V/cell to activate the protection circuit, at which point a normal charge commences. Caution is required if a Li-ion has dwelled below 1.5V/cell for a week or longer. Dendrites may have developed that could compromise safety. (See BU-802b: What does Elevated Self-discharge Do? in which Figures 5 examines the elevated self-discharge after a Li-ion cell had been exposed to deep discharge. See also BU-808a: How to Awaken Sleeping Li-ion)\nLead- and lithium-based chargers operate on constant current constant voltage (CCCV). The charge current is constant and the voltage is capped when it reaches a set limit. Reaching the voltage limit, the battery saturates; the current drops until the battery can no longer accept further charge and the fast charge terminates. Each battery has its own low-current threshold.\nNickel-based batteries charge with constant current and the voltage is allowed to rise freely. This can be compared to lifting a weight with a rubber band where the hand advances higher than the load. Full charge detection occurs when observing a slight voltage drop after a steady rise. To safeguard against anomalies, such as shorted or mismatched cells, the charger should include a plateau timer to assure a safe charge termination if no voltage delta is detected. Temperature sensing should also be added that measures temperature rise over time. Such a method is known as delta temperature over delta time, or dT/dt, and works well with rapid and fast charge.\nA temperature rise is normal with nickel-based batteries, especially when reaching the 70 percent charge level. A decrease in charge efficiency causes this, and the charge current should be lowered to limit stress. When “ready,” the charger switches to trickle charge and the battery must cool down. If the temperature stays above ambient, then the charger is not performing correctly and the battery should be removed because the trickle charge could be too high.\nNiCd and NiMH should not be left in the charger unattended for weeks and months. Until required, store the batteries in a cool place and apply a charge before use.\nLithium-based batteries should always stay cool on charge. Discontinue the use of a battery or charger if the temperature rises more than 10ºC (18ºF) above ambient under a normal charge. Li ion cannot absorb over-charge and does not receive trickle charge when full. It is not necessary to remove Li-ion from the charger; however, if not used for a week or more, it is best to place the pack in a cool place and recharge before use.\nThe most basic charger was the overnight charger, also known as a slow charger. This goes back to the old nickel-cadmium days where a simple charger applied a fixed charge of about 0.1C (one-tenth of the rated capacity) as long as the battery was connected. Slow chargers have no full-charge detection; the charge stays engaged and a full charge of an empty battery takes 14–16 hours. When fully charged, the slow charger keeps NiCd lukewarm to the touch. Because of its reduced ability to absorb over-charge, NiMH should not be charged on a slow charger. Low-cost consumer chargers charging AAA, AA and C cells often deploy this charge method, so do some children’s toys. Remove the batteries when warm.\nThe rapid charger falls between the slow and fast charger and is used in consumer products. The charge time of an empty pack is 3–6 hours. When full, the charger switches to “ready.” Most rapid chargers include temperature sensing to safely charge a faulty battery.\nThe fast charger offers several advantages and the obvious one is shorter charge times. This demands tighter communication between the charger and battery. At a charge rate of 1C, (see BU-402:What is C-rate?) which a fast charger typically uses, an empty NiCd and NiMH charges in a little more than an hour. As the battery approaches full charge, some nickel-based chargers reduce the current to adjust to the lower charge acceptance. The fully charged battery switches the charger to trickle charge, also known as maintenance charge. Most of today’s nickel-based chargers have a reduced trickle charge to also accommodate NiMH.\nLi-ion has minimal losses during charge and the coulombic efficiency is better than 99 percent. At 1C, the battery charges to 70 percent state-of-charge (SoC) in less than an hour; the extra time is devoted to the saturation charge. Li-ion does not require the saturation charge as lead acid does; in fact it is better not to fully charge Li-ion — the batteries will last longer but the runtime will be a little less. Of all chargers, Li-ion is the simplest. No trickery applies that promises to improve battery performance as is often claimed by makers of chargers for lead- and nickel-based batteries. Only the rudimentary CCCV method works.\nLead acid cannot be fast charged and the term “fast-charge” is a misnomer. Most lead acid chargers charge the battery in 14–16 hours; anything slower is a compromise. Lead acid can be charged to 70 percent in about 8 hours; the all-important saturation charge takes up the remaining time. A partial charge is fine provided the lead acid occasionally receives a fully saturated charge to prevent sulfation.\nThe standby current on a charger should be low to save energy. Energy Star assigns five stars to mobile phone chargers and other small chargers drawing 30mW or less on standby. Four stars go to chargers with 30–150mW, three stars to 150–250mW and two stars to 250–350mW. The average consumption is 300mW and these units get one star. Energy Star aims to reduce current consumption of personal chargers that are mostly left plugged in when not in use. There are over one billion such chargers connected to the gird globally at any given time.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

We recommend posting your question in the comment sections for the Battery University Group (BUG) to share.\nHi, I have 2 questions about \"smart\" battery chargers. The chargers I am referring to are the type used to charge 12 volt automotive or marine batteries.\n1.  These chargers will vary their voltage depending on the voltage they \"see\" at the battery. However, I understand it takes time for a battery being charged to \"stabilize\" it's voltage.  In other words a battery that has just been taken off charge will likely show a higher voltage than it would  hours later (even when it is not being used or discharged). This is because it takes a while for the charge to \"percolate\" through the battery. Given this, how can a smart charger possibly detect an accurate voltage at the battery, when it is attempting to ascertain thew correct voltage for charging ?\n2. A related question is when using a multi-battery bank charger, meant to charge several batteries (usually 2 or 3) at once (batteries in different \"banks\" that are not connected).   All of the chargers of this type that I know of say in the case where only one battery is being charged, to connect all of the leads to the same battery. How can they detect the correct voltage at the battery and not get confused by their own charging voltage?\nPorfa yo tengo una Motorina Águila con una batería de 35Amperes y quisiera saber cómo hacer un mejor uso de mi batería, vivo en Cuba, perooooo deseo consejos para conservar aun más la batería que tengo. O sea consejos prácticos y útiles sobre el cargue de la batería.\nPorfa yo tengo una Motorina Águila con una batería de 35Amperes y quisiera saber cómo hacer un mejor uso de mi batería, vivo en Cuba, perooooo deseo consejos para conservar aun más la batería que tengo.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/recognizing-battery-capacity-as-the-missing-link",
        "content": "Battery users want state-of-charge (SoC) and remaining runtime clearly displayed on their devices. Smartphones apps do this in an amazing way, but one questions the resource on which the information is based on. While data can easily be digitized for a make-believe show, the electrochemical battery, the heart of the power source, is complex, multifaceted and poorly understood.\nMost users see the battery as an energy storage device resembling a fuel tank dispensing liquid fuel. For simplicity reasons, a battery can indeed be compared as such a vessel; however, measuring stored energy in an electrochemical device is far more complex than drawing fluid from a fixed container.\nWhile a regular fuel gauge is static and measures liquid flowing from a tank of known size, the battery fuel gauge is dynamic and has unconfirmed definitions. The open circuit voltage (OCV) provides only rough SoC estimations of a vessel that is gradually diminishing in size. Even if the battery capacity has dropped from 100% to 50% with usage and age, the fuel gauge will still display 100% charge after a recharge. One asks: “100% of what?” No relationship exists between SoC and state-of-health (SoH), and showing SoC while hiding SoH is a major drawback of most battery fuel gauges. Considering these limitations, battery users begin to understand why battery fuel gauges are notoriously inaccurate.\nThe most simplistic way to read SoC is by voltage, but this can be inaccurate and here is why. Batteries within a given chemistry have dissimilar architectures and deliver unique voltage profiles. Temperature also plays a role; heat raises the voltage and cold lowers it. In addition, charging and discharging agitate the battery and the voltage no longer represents a correct SoC reference. A battery requires few hours of rest to regain equilibrium, and for lead acid this can be 24 hours. Loads and charge currents distort the voltage further, but one of the largest challenges is the flat discharge voltage curve of some lithium-based systems. This is especially evident with lithium-iron phosphate.\nIn spite of these limitations, voltage-based SoC somehow works. Reasonably good accuracies are attainable by compensating for irregularities and hiding some reserve capacity. No one will ever know how much energy is left in the battery unless one runs out of power.\nBattery sensing as part of a battery management system (BMS) is making inroads into vehicles. Figure 1 shows a sensor for a starter battery that reads voltage, current and temperature to provide SoC and detect anomalies. These devices perform reasonably well when the battery is new but lose accuracy with time. Aging occurs differently when operating the battery at high temperatures or exposing it to harsh loading. False alarms are common as a one-size-fits-all algorithm to compensate for aging is difficult to implement.\nFigure 1: Battery sensor for starter battery\nThe sensor reads voltage, current and temperature to estimate state-of-charge and detect anomalies; capacity assessment is not possible.\nBMS also observes batteries in mobile phones, laptops, medical equipment, electric vehicles and other electronic devices. The management system protects lithium-ion cells from over-voltage, prevents excess current and detects temperature extremes to maintain safe operation and attain a long battery life. BMS also estimates SoC, reports secondary data, and sometimes also perform cell balancing. Advanced systems include coulomb counting the track in and out-flowing currents.\nCoulomb counting improves the BMS but this is not totally foolproof; the outflowing energy is always less than what had been fed into the battery. Internal losses and self-discharge contribute to this deficit. Over time, a tracking error develops between the electrochemical and digital battery that must be corrected through calibration by applying one or several charge and discharge cycles. Periodic cycling can be omitted if the battery receives regular full discharges on its own accord.\nModern fuel gauges include a learn function that observes user patterns. Learn also measures how much energy the battery delivered on the previous discharge and notes charge times because a faded battery charges quicker than a good one as there is less to fill. Some systems also record cycle count, depth of discharge, loading conditions and temperature to derive at battery state-of-health (SoH). A BMS with learn may omit calibration; capacity estimations are possible but the battery must remain with the host. Most batteries in a mobile phones, laptops and car are subservient to the host and would qualify.\nCapacity is the leading health indicator that discloses how much energy a battery can hold. Capacity also determines the runtime and governs the end-of-battery-life. There are three methods to estimate capacity: [1] by fully discharging a charged battery and tracking the elapsed time; [2] by observing values such as voltages, internal resistance, charge and discharge times; and [3] by examining the electrochemical battery with a frequency spectroscopy as if to do an “x-ray” scan. This article looks at the latest advances in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), a technology that goes to the heart of the battery.\nThe ultimate goal is to test a battery in a few seconds. Battery test devices are available that claim to do this, but most rely on voltage and internal resistance readings. Lead acid and Li-ion batteries have improved; better electrolytes keep the internal resistance low by reducing corrosion. This makes resistive measurements obsolete as a quick and simple SoH check.\nTo examine the relationship between resistance and capacity, Cadex examined 175 aging starter batteries and found a correlation of only 0.55. A perfect equal would be 1. Li-ion behaves similarly to lead acid; however nickel-based batteries can still be assessed by a resistive measurement.\nAsserting that a battery tester based on internal resistance is capable of estimating capacity is misleading. Promoting features that lay outside the equipment’s capabilities confuses the industry into believing that multifaceted results are attainable with basic test functions. Manufacturers are aware of the complexity of evaluating batteries, but this does not prevent them from over-promising. An analogy can be made with a shampoo that promises to grow lush hair on a man’s baldhead.\nScientists place high confidence in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. EIS scans a battery with a frequency that ranges from 1–2000Hz. The reflected signal produces a Nyquist plot that characterizes the individual components of the Randles model. Randles is a representation of a battery consisting of ohmic and reactive components. A simplistic model is illustrated in Figure 2. Although EIS is capable of reading the individual values by extraction, capacity estimation is not possible.\nFigure 2: Randles model of a lead acid battery\nThe overall battery resistance consists of ohmic resistance, as well as inductive and capacitive reactance. The values differ for each battery.\nCadex Electronics advanced EIS one step further and developed multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy or Spectroä for short. The Spectro™ engine is placed in the Spectro CA-12, a handheld battery tester that is capable of reading battery capacity, CCA and state-of-charge of a lead acid battery in a non-invasive 15-second test. The instrument scans a battery with a 20-2,000 Hertz signal as if to take a landscape, and a DSP (digital signal processor) crunches through 40 million transactions to calculate the results. The tester uses a matrix as a reference, the battery must have a SoC of at least 60%; the test can be done under a steady load but not while charging. Figure 3 illustrates the instrument.\nFigure 3: Spectro CA-12 battery tester\nCompact battery rapid-tester based on multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reading capacity, CCA and state-of-charge in 15 seconds.\nPatented technology\nThe Spectro™ engine can also be used for monitoring applications by adding the missing link, capacity. This converts a simple battery sensor to an advanced BMS. With capacity and state-of-charge known, a tri-state fuel gauge can be developed that reveals the available energy, the empty portion that can be refilled and the unusable part that is permanently lost. This leads to the all-encompassing state-of-function (SoF) reflecting a snapshot of a battery at any given time. Figure 4 illustrates this concept.\nFigure 4: Tri-state fuel gauge\nThe tri-state fuel gauge estimates the usable capacity, empty portion and unusable part.\nKnowing SoF greatly improves battery validation, but some device manufacturers would be hesitant to show the consumer a capacity that is less that 100%, especially during the warranty period. Consumer concerns but aside, SoF will offer a significant advancement for industries that depend on batteries as it discloses the remaining battery capacity to calculates runtime and predict eventual replacement.\nDevelopments are underway to also measure SoC with EIS. This will provide SoC estimation independent of voltage, enabling to read the remaining energy of a battery under a load. One of the challenges will be the development of matrices for each battery type of group. Matrices are lookup tables against which the battery is compared to estimate capacity and SoC.\nMore research will be needed in the field of battery diagnostics and monitoring. Current technologies lag behind those achieved in microelectronics and pharmaceuticals. It appears as if battery testing still dwells in medieval times. We don’t even have a reliable method to measure state-of-charge; assessing capacity, the leading health indicator, still lags behind.\nProfessor Mark Orazem compares the complexity of testing batteries with the Indian tale in which blind men touch an elephant to learn the substance. Each man feels a different part of the body, compares notes, but then disagrees at the end. Battery diagnostics is complex even for a sighted man as there is no single measurement that can quantify the condition of a battery with certainty. Only a set of carefully obtained characteristics will lead to a correct diagnostics.\nFigure 5: Indian tale\nStory of blind men trying to figure out an elephant through touch. The tale provides insight into the relativism and opaqueness of a subject matter, such as a battery.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Batteries are safe, but caution is necessary when touching damaged cells and when handling lead acid systems that have access to lead and sulfuric acid. Several countries label lead acid as hazardous material, and rightly so. Lead can be a health hazard if not properly handled.\nLead is a toxic metal that can enter the body by inhalation of lead dust or ingestion when touching the mouth with lead-contaminated hands. If leaked onto the ground, acid and lead particles contaminate the soil and become airborne when dry. Children and fetuses of pregnant women are most vulnerable to lead exposure because their bodies are developing. Excessive levels of lead can affect a child’s growth, cause brain damage, harm kidneys, impair hearing and induce behavioral problems. In adults, lead can cause memory loss and lower the ability to concentrate, as well as harm the reproductive system. Lead is also known to cause high blood pressure, nerve disorders, and muscle and joint pain. Researchers speculate that Ludwig van Beethoven became ill and died because of lead poisoning.\nLead occurs naturally in soil at 15–40mg/kg level. This level can increase multi-fold near lead battery manufacturing and recycling plants. Soil levels in developing countries, including on the continent of Africa, recorded lead contamination levels of 40–140,000mg/kg. (See BU-705: How to Recycle Batteries)\nThe sulfuric acid in a lead acid battery is highly corrosive and is more harmful than acids used in most other battery systems. Contact with eye can cause permanent blindness; swallowing damages internal organs that can lead to death. First aid treatment calls for flushing the skin for 10–15 minutes with large amounts of water to cool the affected tissue and to prevent secondary damage. Immediately remove contaminated clothing and thoroughly wash the underlying skin. Always wear protective equipment when handling sulfuric acid.\nCadmium used in nickel-cadmium batteries is considered more harmful than lead if ingested. Workers at NiCd manufacturing plants in Japan have been experiencing health problems from prolonged exposure to the metal, and governments have banned disposal of nickel-cadmium batteries in landfills. The soft, whitish metal that occurs naturally in the soil can damage kidneys. Cadmium can be absorbed through the skin by touching a spilled battery. Since most NiCd batteries are sealed, there are no health risks in handling intact cells; caution is required when working with an open battery.\nNickel-metal-hydride is considered non-toxic and the only concern is the electrolyte. Although toxic to plants, nickel is not harmful to humans.\nLithium-ion is also benign — the battery contains little toxic material. Nevertheless, caution is required when working with a damaged battery. When handling a spilled battery, do not touch your mouth, nose or eyes. Wash your hands thoroughly.\nKeep small batteries out of children’s reach. Children younger than four are the most likely to swallow batteries, and the most common types that are ingested are button cells. Each year in the United States alone, more than 2,800 children are treated in emergency rooms for swallowing button batteries. According to a 2015 report, serious injuries and deaths from swallowing batteries have increased nine-fold in the last decade.\nThe battery often gets stuck in the esophagus (the tube that passes food). Water or saliva creates an electrical current that can trigger a chemical reaction producing hydroxide, a caustic ion that causes serious burns to the surrounding tissue. Doctors often misdiagnose the symptoms, which can reveal themselves as fever, vomiting, poor appetite and weariness. Batteries that make it through the esophagus often move through the digestive tract with little or no lasting damage. The advice to a parent is to choose safe toys and to keep small batteries away from young children.\nCharging batteries in living quarters should be safe, and this also applies to lead acid. Ventilate the area regularly as you would a kitchen when cooking. Lead acid produces some hydrogen gas but the amount is minimal when charged correctly. Hydrogen gas becomes explosive at a concentration of 4 percent. This would only be achieved if large lead acid batteries were charged in a sealed room.\nOver-charging a lead acid battery can produce hydrogen sulfide. The gas is colorless, very poisonous, flammable and has the odor of rotten eggs. Hydrogen sulfide also occurs naturally during the breakdown of organic matter in swamps and sewers; it is present in volcanic gases, natural gas and some well waters. Being heavier than air, the gas accumulates at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Although noticeable at first, the sense of smell deadens the sensation with time and potential victims may be unaware of its presence.\nAs a simple guideline, hydrogen sulfide becomes harmful to human life if the odor is noticeable. Turn off the charger, vent the facility and stay outside until the odor disappears. Other gases that can develop during charging and the operations of lead acid batteries are arsine (arsenic hydride, AsH3) and (antimony hydride, SbH3). Although the levels of these metal hydrides stay well below the occupational exposure limits, they are a reminder to provide adequate ventilation.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-304c: Battery Safety in Public",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-304c-battery-safety-in-public",
        "content": "The interest in batteries is growing, but stored energy must be respected. Children and adults alike are often unaware of the potential safety hazards when experimenting with batteries by heating cells, crushing them or applying an electrical short. Some batteries disintegrate with such a force they can cause serious harm, such as the loss of an arm or death. The damage inflicted depends on the chemistry and lithium-based cells are the most potent. Pay special attention to lithium-metal, the most energy-dense cell that is also the most powerful when stressed beyond its limits.\nHealth Canada reports receiving over 100 consumer reports in one year involving batteries. Failures involved overheating and starting fires. Officials responsible for safety say: “Any type of battery could be a potentially problem.” This applies mainly to batteries containing lithium. Smoke detectors are highly recommended to alert smoldering before a fire develops.\nFolks are familiar with the alkaline, but this is the pussycat of batteries. Other systems are less forgiving and this article looks at common battery systems in the hands of the consumer. We learn how to care for batteries, what to watch for when traveling and how to stay out of trouble with correct handling.\nAlkaline is the most common household battery. It provides longer runtime and is slightly more expensive than the zinc-carbon that it replaced. Lewis Urry (1927–2004) invented the alkaline in 1949 while working with the Eveready Battery Company laboratory in Ohio, USA.\nA household alkaline has about 40 percent more energy than the average Li-ion. Alkaline is environmentally friendly and does not leak when depleted, as the old zinc-carbon did that came on the market in 1868. Alkaline has a very low self-discharge and can be stored for up to 10 years. It has a good safety record and can be carried on an aircraft without subject to UN Transport and other regulations.\nThe negative of alkaline is high internal resistance that limits current loading to light loads only, such as remote controls, flashlights and portable entertainment devices. This has an advantage in that alkaline can safely be carried in our jeans. An electrical short with keys or coins will cause the cell the heat up but there should be no fire.\nIn spite of alkaline being forgiving, never mix batteries metallic objects. Do not store batteries in close proximity to flammable materials. There are reported incidents of batteries setting fire. Fire inspectors recommend storage containers that secure batteries so the positive and negatives terminals won’t touch.\nAlkaline batteries cannot be charged, or at least they should not. This does not stop individuals from trying to get some energy back into the cell. Ordinary alkaline batteries have been recharged in households for many years. Recharging is most effective if the cell is not discharged beyond 50 percent. Depth of discharge governs the number of recharges and is limited to just a few. Battery makers do not endorse this practice for safety reasons; charging ordinary alkaline batteries may generate hydrogen gas that can lead to an explosion. (See BU-211: Alternate Battery Systems; go to Reusable Alkaline).\nThe button cell, also known as a coin cell, is used in toys, watches, hearing aids and medical devices. Children like to play with button cells, putting them in their mouth and possibly swallowing them. In the United States alone, each year more than 2,800 children are treated in emergency rooms for swallowing button batteries. According to a 2015 report, injuries and deaths from swallowing batteries has increased nine-fold in the last decade. (See BU-703: Health Concerns with Batteries)\nIf swallowed, the battery often gets stuck in the esophagus (the tube that passes food). Water or saliva creates a conduit for electrical current that triggers a chemical reaction producing hydroxide, a caustic ion that can cause serious burns to the surrounding tissue. Doctors often misdiagnose the revealing symptoms revealing as fever, vomiting, poor appetite and weariness. Batteries that make it through the esophagus often move through the digestive tract with little or no lasting damage, although they can ulcerate the stomach wall.\nThe advice to parents is to choose safe toys and to keep small batteries away from young children. Similar to pharmaceutical products, keep small batteries locked away from small children.\nDo not store starter batteries where children play as the terminals of a starter battery are made of lead. Lead acid also has one of the most corrosive electrolytes of all batteries that must be safeguarded.\nFrom 1991-2016, 138 airport and flight incidents involving lithium batteries occurred. These include 13 E-cigarettes, 7 mobile phones/tablets, 7 spare batteries and 4 laptops. E-cigarette incidents increased the most.\nAccording to published reports, 68 percent of battery failure in transit is caused by short circuit, and poor packaging is much to blame. Do not store and transport bare batteries in a metal box; do not mix batteries with coins, house keys in your jeans. Always put cells and batteries in clear plastic bags.\nFigure 5 shows a pair of burned jeans in which a Li-ion cell came in contact with loose coins in the pocket. It inflicted third degree burns on the man’s leg. Little can be done to stop the flaming event once it has begun.\nWhile Li-ion is rechargeable, there are non-rechargeable lithium batteries that exceed Li-ion in capacity. They contain a metallic anode and are often called lithium-metal. This increases volatility and these batteries are subject to tighter shipping regulations than the more benign lithium-ion. Primary lithium batteries come in many varieties and are mainly used for industrial uses. (See BU-106a: Choices of Primary Batteries)\nLithium iron disulfide (LiFeS2) is a replacement of the regular household alkaline with longer runtimes and better loading capabilities. Lithium batteries normally deliver 3 volts and higher, LiFeS2 is 1.5 volts, making it compatible with the AA and AAA formats. They cost slightly more than alkaline and must follow transportation rules.\nLithium thionyl chloride (LiSOCI2 or LTC) can withstand high heat and strong vibration. Thanks to the wide temperature operating range, LTC batteries are mainly used for horizontal drilling, also known as fracking that reaches head temperatures of 125°C (257°F). With a specific energy of over 500Wh/kg, they offer twice the capacity of the best Li-ion. Even though rugged and seemingly indestructible, this battery is one of the most potent if abused. Because of the potential danger, LTC is not permitted in consumer products; it also requires training for handling.\nLithium manganese dioxide (LiMnO2 or Li-M) is another common metallic lithium battery that is more benign than LTC. It comes with a lower capacity and is safe for public use. Typical uses are meter sensing, medical devices, road toll sensors and cameras.\nLi-ion batteries are safe but what may not be fully understood with a growing battery population is aging. Users ask: “Will my battery die quietly or depart with a bang?” Typical usage patterns that stress a Li-ion battery are excessive loading, rapid-charging and charging below freezing. Furthermore, storing Li-ion at a voltage below 2 volts per cell leads to dendrite growth that can damage the separator and cause a mild electrical short that can progress into a full electrical short, even if kept in storage. A small water leak in a faulty hydro dam can advance to a torrent and take a structure down, so also can separator damage lead to venting with flame. The temperature rises to 500°C (932°F), at which point the cell catches fire or explodes.\nIf a Li-ion battery overheats, hisses, or bulges, immediately move the device with battery away from flammable materials and place it on a non-combustible surface. If at all possible, remove the battery from the device and put it outdoors to burn out.\nA small Li-ion fire can be handled like any other combustible fire. For best result use a foam extinguisher, CO2, ABC dry chemical, powdered graphite, copper powder or soda (sodium carbonate). If the fire occurs in an airplane cabin, the FAA instructs flight attendants to use water or soda pop. Water-based products are most readily available and are appropriate since Li-ion contains very little lithium metal that could react with water. Water also cools the adjacent area and prevents the fire from spreading. (See BU-304a: Safety Concerns with Li-ion)\nA large Li-ion fire, such as in an EV, may need to burn out as water is ineffective. When encountering a fire with a lithium-metal battery, only use a Class D fire extinguisher. Lithium-metal contains of lithium that reacts with water and makes the fire worse. Do not use the Class D fire extinguisher for regular fires.\nA recent study from George Mason University estimated over 2,000 visits to U.S. emergency rooms caused from explosion-related injuries from e-cigarette burns from 2015 to 2017. Most injured were men putting e-cigarette batteries in their jeans or shirt pockets. Some also had keys in their pocket, a dangerous mix of metal and lithium-ion batteries causing an electric short. Many experienced severe burns to their legs, arms and hands, even death.

        "title": "BU-401a: Fast and Ultra-fast Chargers",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-401a-fast-and-ultra-fast-chargers",
        "content": "Nowhere is ultra-fast charging in bigger demand than with the electric vehicle (EV). Recharging an EV in minutes replicates the convenience of filling 50 liters (13 gallons) of fuel into a tank that delivers 600kWh of energy. Such large energy storage in an electrochemical device is not practical as a battery with such a capacity would weigh 6 tons. Most Li-ion only produces about 150Wh per kg; the energy from fossil fuel is roughly 100 times higher. (See BU-1007: Net Calorific Value).\nCharging an EV will always take longer than filling a tank, and the battery will always deliver less energy per weight than fossil fuel. Breaking the rule of law and forcing ultra-fast charging adds stress, even if the battery is designed for such a purpose. We must keep in mind that a battery is sluggish in nature. Like an aging man, its physical condition becomes less ideal with use and age. So is the ability to fast-charge. One assumes that all charge energy goes into the battery, whether charged slowly, rapidly or by ultra-fast method. Batteries are nonlinear devices and most chemistry accepts a fast charge from empty up to about 50% state-of-charge (SoC) with little losses. NiCd does this best and suffers the least amount of strain. Stresses occur in the second half of the charge cycle towards full charge when acceptance becomes labored. An analogy is enjoying the dessert after the hunger is stilled.\nApplying an ultra-fast charge when the battery is empty and then tapering off the current when reaching 50% SoC and higher is called step charging. The laptop industry has been applying step charging for many years, so does the EV. The charge currents must harmonize with the battery type as different battery systems have dissimilar requirements in charge acceptance. Battery manufacturers do not publish charge rates as a function of SoC. Much of this is proprietary information.\nResearch companies claim to achieve benefits with pulse-charging Li-ion instead of applying the regular CCCV charge as described in BU-409: Charging Lithium-ion. The scientific community is skeptical of alternative charging and takes the “wait-and-see” approach.\nAs our bodies work best at 37ºC (98ºF), so does the transport mechanism improve when a battery is warm. Modern EVs will enable the “pre-charge” feature to prepare the battery temperature for the pending fast-charge while driving. (See also BU-410: Charging at High and Low Temperatures)\nWhether you own an EV, e-bike, a drone, a portable device or a hobby gadget, the following conditions must be respected when charging a battery the ultra-fast way:\nAn ultra-fast charger can be compared to a high-speed train (Figure 1) traveling at 300km per hour (188 mph). Increasing power is relatively simple. It’s the track that governs the permissible speed of a train and not the machinery. In the same manner, the condition of the battery dictates the charging speed.\nA well-designed ultra-fast charger evaluates the condition of the “chemical battery” and makes adjustments according to the ability to receive a charge. The charger should also include temperature compensations and other safety features to lower the charge current when certain conditions exist and halt the charge if the battery is under undue stress.\nA “smart” battery running on SMBus or other protocols is responsible for the charge current. The system observes the battery condition and lowers or discontinues the charge if an anomaly occurs. Common irregularities are cell imbalance or the need for calibration. Some “smart” batteries stop functioning if the error is not corrected.\nThe automotive industry is demanding ultra-fast charging. Research laboratories are responding by heating Li-ion batteries to a temperature that prevents lithium plating while limiting the growth of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that occurs at elevated temperatures. The chosen charging temperature is 60ºC (140ºF), heated by heating elements for the duration of the charge and then cooled to about 24ºC (75ºF) with the onboard cooling system of the EV to limit the time the battery dwells at high heat. This enables charging Li-ion at a C-rate of 6C to 80% SoC in 10 minutes.\nCharging at 60ºC prevents lithium plating while deterring SEI growth because of the short duration at high temperatures.\nA technology called Aligned Graphite® Technology claims to reduce a charge time of 25 minutes to only 15 minutes by organizing the graphite flake on the negative electrode into vertical order. Battrion, a spin-off of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), says that this orientation reduces the distance lithium travels, enabling very high charge and discharge currents without degradation.\nThe maximum charge current a Li-ion can accept is governed by cell design, and not the cathode material, as is commonly assumed. The goal is to avoid lithium-plating on the anode and to keep the temperature under control. A thin anode with high porosity and small graphite particles enables ultra-fast charging because of the large surface area. Power Cells can be charged and discharged at high currents, but the energy density is low. Energy Cells, in comparison, have a thicker anode and lower porosity and the charge rate should 1C or less. Some hybrid Cells in NCA (nickel-cobalt-aluminum) can be charged above 1C with only moderate stress.\nApply the ultra-fast charge only when necessary. A well-designed ultra-fast charger should have the charge-time selection to give the user the option to choose the least stressful charge for the time allotted. Figure 3 compares the cycle life of a typical lithium-ion battery when charged and discharged at 1C, 2C and 3C rates. The longevity can further be prolonged by charging and discharging below 1C; 0.8C is the recommended rate.\nCharging and discharging Li-ion above 1C reduces service life. Use a slower charge and discharge if possible. This rule applies to most batteries.\nLithium deposition forms if the charge rate exceeds the ability by which lithium can be intercalated into the negative graphite electrode of Li-ion. A film of metallic lithium forms on the negative electrode that spreads uniformly over the host material or gravitates to one region in planar, mossy or dendritic format. The dendritic form is of concern because it may increase self-discharge that in extreme cases can create a short and lead to venting with flame.\nEnvironmental conditions affect the deposition of lithium as follows:\nConsumers demand fast charging at low temperatures and this is especially critical with the electric vehicle. Solutions include special electrolyte additives and solvents, optimal negative to positive electrode ratios, and special cell design.\nThe question is often asked; “Why do ultra-fast chargers charge a battery to only 70 and 80 percent?” This may be done on purpose to reduce stress, but is also caused naturally by a lag between voltage and state-of-charge that amplifies the faster the battery is being charged. This can be compared to a rubber band lifting a heavyweight. The larger the weight, the wider the lag becomes. The ultra-fast charge forces the voltage to the 4.20V/cell ceiling quickly while the battery is only partially charged. A full charge will occur at a slower pace as part of saturation.\nLithium Titanate may be the exception and allow ultra-fast charging without undue stress. This feature will likely be used in future EVs; however, Li-titanate has lower specific energy than cobalt-blended Li-ion and the battery is expensive. (See BU-205: Types of Lithium-ion)\nNickel-cadmium is another battery chemistry that can be charged in minutes to 70 percent state-of-charge. Like with most batteries, the charge acceptance drops towards full charge and the charge current must be reduced.\nAll ultra-fast methods need high power. An ultra-fast EV charge station draws the equivalent electrical power of five households. Charging a fleet of EVs could dim a city.\nAll batteries perform best at room temperature and with a moderate charge and discharge. Such a sheltered lifestyle does not always reflect real-world situations where a compact pack must be charged quickly and deliver high currents. Such typical applications are drones and remote control devices for hobbyists. Expect a short cycle life when a small pack must give all it has.\nIf fast charging and high load requirements are prerequisites, the rugged Power Cell is ideal; however, this increases battery size and weight. An analogy is choosing a heavy diesel engine to run a large truck instead of a souped-up engine designed for a sports car. The big diesel will outlive the light engine even if both have the identical horsepower. Going heavier will be more economical in the long run.

        "content": "The purpose of a battery is to store energy and release it at a desired time. This section examines discharging under different C-rates and evaluates the depth of discharge to which a battery can safely go. The document also observes different discharge signatures and explores battery life under diverse loading patterns.\nThe electrochemical battery has the advantage over other energy storage devices in that the energy stays high during most of the charge and then drops rapidly as the charge depletes. The supercapacitor has a linear discharge, and compressed air and a flywheel storage device is the inverse of the battery by delivering the highest power at the beginning. Figures 1, 2 and 3 illustrate the simulated discharge characteristics of stored energy.\nMost rechargeable batteries can be overloaded briefly, but this must be kept short. Battery longevity is directly related to the level and duration of the stress inflicted, which includes charge, discharge and temperature.\nRemote control (RC) hobbyists are a special breed of battery users who stretch tolerance of “frail” high-performance batteries to the maximum by discharging them at a C-rate of 30C, 30 times the rated capacity. As thrilling as an RC helicopter, race car and fast boat can be; the life expectancy of the packs will be short. RC buffs are well aware of the compromise and are willing to both pay the price and to encounter added safety risks.\nTo get maximum energy per weight, drone manufacturers gravitate to cells with a high capacity and choose the Energy Cell. This is in contrast to industries requiring heavy loads and long service life. These applications go for the more robust Power Cell at a reduced capacity.\nLead acid discharges to 1.75V/cell; nickel-based system to 1.0V/cell; and most Li-ion to 3.0V/cell. At this level, roughly 95 percent of the energy is spent, and the voltage would drop rapidly if the discharge were to continue. To protect the battery from over-discharging, most devices prevent operation beyond the specified end-of-discharge voltage.\nWhen removing the load after discharge, the voltage of a healthy battery gradually recovers and rises towards the nominal voltage. Differences in the affinity of metals in the electrodes produce this voltage potential even when the battery is empty. A parasitic load or high self-discharge prevents voltage recovery.\nA high load current, as would be the case when drilling through concrete with a power tool, lowers the battery voltage and the end-of-discharge voltage threshold is often set lower to prevent premature cutoff. The cutoff voltage should also be lowered when discharging at very cold temperatures, as the battery voltage drops and the internal battery resistance rises. Table 4 shows typical end-of-discharge voltages of various battery chemistries.\nOver-charging a lead acid battery can produce hydrogen sulfide, a colorless, poisonous and flammable gas that smells like rotten eggs. Hydrogen sulfide also occurs during the breakdown of organic matter in swamps and sewers and is present in volcanic gases and natural gas. The gas is heavier than air and accumulates at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Strong at first, the sense of smell deadens with time, and the victims are unaware of the presence of the gas. (See BU-703: Health Concerns with Batteries)\nA discharge/charge cycle is commonly understood as the full discharge of a charged battery with subsequent recharge, but this is not always the case. Batteries are seldom fully discharged, and manufacturers often use the 80 percent depth-of-discharge (DoD) formula to rate a battery. This means that only 80 percent of the available energy is delivered and 20 percent remains in reserve. Cycling a battery at less than full discharge increases service life, and manufacturers argue that this is closer to a field representation than a full cycle because batteries are commonly recharged with some spare capacity left.\nThere is no standard definition as to what constitutes a discharge cycle. Some cycle counters add a full count when a battery is charged. A smart battery may require a 15 percent discharge after charge to qualify for a discharge cycle; anything less is not counted as a cycle. A battery in a satellite has a typical DoD of 30–40 percent before the batteries are recharged during the satellite day. A new EV battery may only charge to 80 percent and discharge to 30 percent. This bandwidth gradually widens as the battery fades to provide identical driving distances. Avoiding full charges and discharges reduces battery stress. (See also BU-1003: Electric Vehicle)\nA hybrid car only uses a fraction of the capacity during acceleration before the battery is recharged. Cranking the motor of a vehicle draws less than 5 percent energy from the starter battery, and this is also called a cycle in the automotive industry. Reference to cycle count must be done in context with the respective duty.\nReference to discharge cycle or cycle count does not relate equally well to all battery applications. One example where counting discharge cycles does not reflect state-of-life accurately is in a storage device (ESS). These batteries supplement renewable energies from wind power and photovoltaic by delivering short-term energy when needed and storing if in excess. The time duration between charge and discharged can be in milliseconds; a typical battery state-of-charge is 40–60%. Rather than cycle count, coulomb counting may be used as a means of measuring wear and tear.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) is a maintenance strategy that provides continuous system dependability with a minimal level of maintenance. RCM started in the 1960s and was adopted by the airline industry in the 1970s. The military followed in the 1980s and in the 1990s the process spilled into civil users, such as nuclear power plants, oil & gas, subways, hospitals and more. Defined by the technical standard SAE JA1011, RCM provides risk awareness that improves reliability while reducing the need for invasive maintenance and lowering operational costs.\n“Fix it when broken” worked with old machinery. With air travel, this method no longer applies and United Airlines was the first company to adopt RCM for safety reasons. The design of modern aircraft and new machinery now harmonize with RCM to streamline maintenance.\nRCM will also work to maintain batteries once dependable diagnostic methods become available to measure state-of-health (SoH). But technology is lagging due to complexity and volatility in analysis. Battery performance indicators change when fully charged, empty, agitated or put into storage. Batteries carry the “black box” syndrome and do not reveal their condition to the naked eye. A pack looks the same when fully charged or empty, new or in need of replacement. In comparison, a car tire distorts when low on air or indicates end-of-life when the treads are worn.\nBatteries are often installed and forgotten. A new battery starts with a capacity of 100% and fading goes unnoticed at first. Similar to a mechanical part, batteries can also fail prematurely especially if unduly stressed. Considering the growing importance, batteries should receive the same treatment as a critical part in an aircraft or machine in which wear and tear falls under strict maintenance guidelines.\nRegulatory authorities are aware of battery shortcomings and this is especially apparent in healthcare. Unlike pharmaceutical products that are tightly regulated, batteries are not well controlled. A biomed technician said: “Batteries are the most abused components; staff cares little about them and only does the bare minimum.” The whistleblower goes on to say that: “References to battery maintenance are vague and hidden inside service manuals.”AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation) rates battery management as one of the top 10 challenges. An FDA survey reveals that up to 50% of issues in hospitals are battery related. FDA points to deficiency in battery quality assurance by device manufacturers, lack of understanding in battery systems integration, and not knowing the end of battery life.\nA retiring biomed technician recently organized a workshop in a large hospital in Michigan to discuss battery problems in healthcare. The participants were experienced biomed techs; mostly aged 50 with plenty of hands-on experience. Cadex Electronics participated by asking questions to assist in developing new battery diagnostic technologies. Cadex also participated in a similar workshop in Belgium to learn about battery problems in Europe.\nRCM gained prominence with air transport in decreasing failure and reducing maintenance costs. Batteries are also gaining importance but before RCM can be implemented in earnest, more effective battery diagnostic technologies must be developed. Batteries use different criteria than wear and tear on a mechanical part and observe capacity, internal resistance and self-discharge.\nReducing our dependency on fossil fuels places new responsibilities on the battery. Advancements in Diagnostic Battery Management (DBM) will eventually usher in RCM as a battery maintenance tool.Improvements in batteries do not rest in higher capacity alone, but in delivering a dependable and safe energy source over the entire service life of the battery. DBM assists in battery development by keeping batteries in service longer, lowering operational costs and reducing the environment impact of fabricating and disposing of batteries.\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-807-how-to-restore-nickel-based-batteries",
        "content": "During the nickel-cadmium years of the 1970s and 1980s, battery ills were blamed on “memory.” Today, the word memory is still being used to advertise newer batteries as being “memory-free.” Memory comes from “cyclic memory,” meaning that a nickel-cadmium battery could remember how much energy was drawn on previous discharges and it would deliver the same amount on repeat discharges. If more was demanded, the voltage would abruptly drop as if to protest against imposed overtime.\nMemory occurs when keeping a NiCd battery is overcharged. The effect can be reversed with a pulse charge, but it is more effectively to apply a full discharge cycle. Figure 1 illustrates the anode of a normal NiCd, memory that formed, and a restored anode.\nThe modern nickel-cadmium battery no longer has cyclic memory, but it suffers from crystalline formation. The active cadmium material is applied on the negative plate and with time, a crystalline formation develops that reduces the surface area and lowers the battery performance. In advanced stages, the sharp edges of the forming crystals can penetrate the separator, causing high self-discharge that can lead to an electrical short.\nWhen introduced in the early 1990s, nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) was hailed as being memory-free, but this claim is only partially true. NiMH is subject to memory but to a lesser degree than NiCd. While NiMH has only the nickel plate to worry about, NiCd also includes the memory-prone cadmium negative electrode. This is a simple explanation of why NiMH is less susceptible to memory than NiCd.\nCrystalline formation occurs if a nickel-based battery is left in the charger for days or repeatedly recharged without a periodic full discharge. Since most applications fall into this user pattern, NiCd requires a periodic discharge to 1 volt per cell to prolong service life. A discharge/charge cycle as part of maintenance, known as exercise, should be done every 1–3 months. Avoid over-exercising as this wears down the battery unnecessarily.\nIf regular exercise is omitted for 6 months or longer, the crystals ingrain themselves and a full restoration with a discharge to 1 volt per cell may no longer be sufficient. Restoration is often possible by applying a secondary discharge called recondition. Recondition is a slow discharge that drains the battery to about 0.4V/cell and lower.\nTests by the US Army indicate that a NiCd cell needs to be discharged to at least 0.6V to effectively break up the more resistant crystalline formations. During this corrective discharge, the current must be kept low to minimize cell reversal as NiCd can only tolerate a small amount of cell reversal(See BU-501: Basics About Discharging) Figure 2 illustrates the battery voltage during a discharge to 1V/cell, followed by the secondary discharge to 0.4V/cell.\nRecondition is most effective in rejuvenating batteries that have not been exercised. Battery analyzers automatically apply the recondition cycle if the user-set target capacity cannot be reached with a discharge to 1V/cell alone. Although low performing batteries can often be fully restored, high self-discharge makes some old-timers unusable for service.\nMost ship batteries in large aircraft are NiCd. Resembling an oversized starter battery in a vehicle, these batteries are serviced by applying a full discharge and keeping each cell at zero volts for 24 hours before recharge. Each cell is then checked for correct voltage, and capacity verification is taken with a full discharge/charge cycle before installing them again in the airplane. Aviation batteries follow strict maintenance schedules.\nAs battery care-giver, you have choices in how to prolong battery life. Each battery system has unique needs in terms of charging, depth of discharge and loading that should be observed.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-303-confusion-with-voltages",
        "content": "A battery is an electrochemical device that produces a voltage potential when placing metals of different affinities into an acid solution (electrolyte). The open circuit voltage (OCV) that develops as part of an electrochemical reaction varies with the metals and electrolyte used.\nApplying a charge or discharge places the battery into the closed circuit voltage (CCV) condition. Charging raises the voltage and discharging lowers it, simulating a rubber band effect. The voltage behavior under a load and charge is governed by the current flow and the internal battery resistance. A low resistance produces low fluctuation under load or charge; a high resistance causes the voltage to swing excessively. Charging and discharging agitates the battery; full voltage stabilization takes up to 24 hours. Temperature also plays a role; a cold temperature lowers the voltage and heat raises it.\nManufacturers rate a battery by assigning a nominal voltage, and with a few exceptions, these voltages follow an agreed convention. Here are the nominal voltages of the most common batteries in brief.\nThe nominal voltage of lead acid is 2 volts per cell, however when measuring the open circuit voltage, the OCV of a charged and rested battery should be 2.1V/cell. Keeping lead acid much below 2.1V/cell will cause the buildup of sulfation. While on float charge, lead acid measures about 2.25V/cell, higher during normal charge.\nIn consumer applications, NiCd and NiMH are rated at 1.20V/cell; industrial, aviation and military batteries adhere to the original 1.25V. There is no difference between the 1.20V and 1.25V cell; the marking is simply preference.\nThe nominal voltage of lithium-ion is 3.60V/cell. Some cell manufacturers mark their Li-ion as 3.70V/cell or higher. This offers a marketing advantage because the higher voltage boosts the watt-hours on paper (voltage multiplied by current equals watts). The 3.70V/cell rating also creates unfamiliar references of 11.1V and 14.8V when connecting three and four cells in series rather than the more familiar 10.80V and 14.40V respectively. Equipment manufacturers adhere to the nominal cell voltage of 3.60V for most Li-ion systems as a power source.\nHow did this higher voltage creep in? The nominal voltage is a function of anode and cathode materials, as well as impedance. Voltage calculations include measuring the mid-way point from a full-charge of 4.20V/cell to the 3.0V/cell cutoff with a 0.5C load. For Li-cobalt the mid-way point is about 3.60V. The same scan done on Li-manganese with a lower internal resistance gives an average voltage of about 3.70V. It should be noted that the higher voltage is often set arbitrarily and does not affect the operation of portable devices or the setting of the chargers. But there are exceptions.\nSome Li-ion batteries with LCO architecture feature a surface coating and electrolyte additives that increase the nominal cell voltage and permit higher charge voltages. To get the full capacity, the charge cut-off voltage for these batteries must be set accordingly. Figure 1 shows typical voltage settings.\nBattery users want to know if Li-ion cells with higher charge voltages compromise longevity and safety. There is limited information available but what is known is that, yes, these batteries have a shorter cycle life than a regular Li-ion; the calendar life can also be less. Since these batteries are mostly used in consumer products, the longevity can be harmonized with obsolescence, making a shorter battery life acceptable. The benefit is longer a runtime because of the gained Wh (Ah x V). All cells must meet regulatory standards and are safe.\nThe phosphate-based lithium-ion has a nominal cell voltage of 3.20V and 3.30V; lithium-titanate is 2.40V. This voltage difference makes these chemistries incompatible with regular Li-ion in terms of cell count and charging algorithm.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

We recommend posting your question in the comment sections for the Battery University Group (BUG) to share.\nI found this page when trying to find an answer to the following: I have (the remains of) a fairly new RP-NPF970 DV battery pack. This was returned by a student after they had dropped (?) it smashing the case and breaking some of the internal contacts. Re-making the contacts between the six F-166958 (LS LR18655K FM1588 10117361) cells as apparant would seem to give a pack of 1.2 v (I do not know the  charge status before disruction) despite the casing reading 7.4v. Until the casing has been recontructed it is too fragile to put on charge, but because of the high cost of the pack I am reluctant to recycle it at this stage of its life. I am not sure how 6 x 3 volt cells in paralel would give an expected voltage of 7.4v unless there is a hole in my maths. If anyone has any ideas about this or is able to fill the possible hole in my knowledge I would be most gratful.\nMarketing low life batteries to induce quicker obsoliscence is criminal. It is touted as  a perfectly ethical practice How sad !\nHow many lithium_ion_cells are in a 3.85V battery and what do STRING or INT has to do with it?\nMy question is about Nominal Voltage:\nWhat is the need of having a Nominal voltage when it's half of the peak voltage? Is there a certain use or Servers a certain purpose?\nMy question is about Float Voltage:\nI have qty-6 12 volt lead acid deep cycle batteries in series for a 30 amp UPS. The UPS keeps them charged and then goes into a float state. All 6 batteries were purchased at the same time and all are the same part number.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/battery-test-methods",
        "content": "From basic Voltage to Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy\nFrom 2013 to 2020, experts predict a 3.7 fold increase in the demand of lithium-ion batteries. This growing dependency on batteries requires advancements in diagnostics to observe capacity loss to maintain reliability as the capacity declines, identify anomalies to prevent catastrophic failures, and predict the end of battery life when the battery fades to a set capacity threshold.A battery resembles a living organism that cannot be measured, only estimated to a varied degree of accuracy based on available symptoms. This simulates a doctor examining a patient by taking multiple tests and applying the law of elimination. Rapid-test methods for batteries have been lagging behind other technologies; complexity and uncertain results when testing outliers are the reasons for the delay.\nCadex realizes the importance of battery diagnostics and has made notable advancements in rapid-test technologies. These developments form the building blocks for Diagnostic Battery Management (DBM), a new direction innovative companies are pursuing in the care and maintenance of batteries. Rather than inventing another new super battery, DBM is vital to assure reliability of current battery systems by monitoring capacity, the leading health indicator, along with other parameters.\nCapacity represents energy storage, internal resistance relates to current delivery, and self-discharge reflects mechanical integrity. All three properties must be met to qualify a battery. In addition to these static characteristics, a battery has different of state-of-charge (SoC), dynamic characteristics that effect battery performance and complicate rapid-testing.Well-developed battery test technologies must recognize all battery conditions and provide reliable results, even if the charge is low. This is a demanding request as a good battery that is only partially charged behaves in a similar way to a faded pack that is fully charged.Test methods range from taking a voltage reading, to measuring the internal resistance by a pulse or AC impedance method, to coulomb counting, and to taking a snapshot of the chemical battery with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Capacity estimations by deciphering the chemical battery are more complex than digital monitoring by coulomb counting. Digging into the chemical battery involves proprietary algorithms and matrices that function as lookup tables similar to letter or face recognition.Voltage and internal resistance do not correlate with capacity and fail to predict the end of battery life effectively, especially with Li-ion and lead acid systems. The truth lies in the chemical battery. A digital measurement alone is subject to failure because the chemical symptoms are not represented.Here are the most common battery test methods:\nReliable results are only possible when robust symptoms are present. This is not always possible, especially with unformatted lead acid batteries or packs that had been in storage. A good battery pulled form service generally provides solid symptoms with good accuracy; readings from a weak battery can be muddled with inconsistent results. Reliable measurements are impossible if the symptoms are vague or not present, which is the case if the battery has turned into a potato. This fools the system and the battery becomes an outlier. Well-developed rapid-test methods should correctly predict 9 batteries out of 10. EIS has the potential to advance further and surpass other technologies.Table 1 summarizes test procedures with the most common battery systems. Lead acid and Li-ion share communalities in keeping low resistance under normal condition. Exceptions are heat fail and mechanical faults that raise the internal resistance and a battery replacement ahead of time. Nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal-hydride, and in part also the primary battery, reveal the end-of-life.\nTable 1: Battery test methods for common battery chemistries. Lead acid and Li-ion share communalities by keeping low resistance under normal condition; nickel-based and primary batteries reveal end-of-life by elevated internal resistance.\nAt a charge efficiency of 99 percent, Li-ion is best suited for digital battery estimation. This helps in BMS design by enabling capacity estimation with coulomb counting. While the readings are instant, occasional calibration is needed to correct the tracking error that occurs with random battery usage. In comparison, nickel-based batteries have low charge efficiency and high self-discharge, deficiencies that would skew digital tracking. Under the right conditions and moderate temperature, lead acid batteries are reasonably efficient but not quite good enough to use coulomb counting effectively.Cold temperature reduces the efficiency of all batteries and affects rapid-testing. Although a battery may function below freezing, charge acceptance is reduced and charge times must be prolonged by lowering the current. Some chargers do this automatically; if not certain, do not charge Li-ion batteries below freezing.\nMark Twain said: “I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.” Efforts to make something “short” also apply in the development of Diagnostic Battery Management. Adding features is easy, but also keeping the price affordable is a challenge. Switching to new microcontrollers with added intelligence and simplifying assembly enables new product features that were unthinkable a few years ago. But as Mark Twain hinted, making something economical takes time.The objective is to advance the battery into a reliable, safe, cost efficient and environmentally sustainable power source. This requires systems that operate in the background with minimal overhead and little extra cost. The goal is to fully utilize each battery and make state-of-health transparent to the user and fleet supervisor. This can make unexpected battery failures a thing of the past.\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "content": "Car makers are extending the driving range of the electric vehicle to resemble a gasoline-powered car. This requires larger batteries that grow exponentially with the distance driven. Figure 1 illustrates the estimated driving ranges with different battery systems and hydrogen as a function of size.\nDoubling battery size does not extend the driving range linearly and the vehicle becomes inefficient with increasing weight. Li-ion performs better than lead acid in energy density, but no battery meets hydrogen with a fuel cell, or fossil fuel feeding the traditional internal combustion engine (not shown). Extending the driving range with a larger tank is almost negligible compared to oversizing a battery. There is a threshold as to battery size and weight in a vehicle; going beyond a critical point has a negative return and efficiency suffers because of increased vehicle weight.\nOversizing the battery does not expand the driving range linearly.Note: 35MPa hydrogen tank refers to 5,000psi.Source: International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 34, 6005-6020 (2009)\nBatteries have low calorific value compared to fossil fuel and it makes little sense to power a freight train, ocean-going ship or large airplane with batteries. A study reveals that replacing kerosene with batteries could keep an aircraft airborne for less than 10 minutes. Cost is another issue and batteries take long to charge. A fill-up that is quickly and conveniently as topping a tank with liquid or gaseous fuel is impossible with an electrochemical device. Charging also needs high power. An ultra-fast EV charge draws the equivalent electrical power of five households. Charging a fleet of EVs could dim a city.\nConversely, fossil fuel cannot match the qualities of a battery that is clean, quiet, and has an instant start-up with the flick of a switch. Although fossil fuel is cheap and readily available, frivolous burning of this resource must stop to save our planet. Finding alternatives that are environmentally friendly, economical and durable is a challenge; the battery fills this requirement only in part.\nAdvancements made in battery technology in the last 20 years are insufficient to replace fossil fuel. Pushing the boundaries of the battery reminds us of its many limitations, which include low energy density; long charging times, high cost and a short life before the packs quits, often without warning. Table 2 illustrates the energy densities of common fuels, including the battery.\nTable 2: Energy densities of fossil fuel and batteries.Fossil fuel carries many times the energy per mass compared to batteries, but electrical power can be utilized more efficiently than burning fossil fuel.Compiled from various sources. Values are approximate.\nDriving range is a key consideration when buying an EV. Cost also plays a role but seldom is battery life mentioned. This may not be the concern for a tire-kicker, nor does the salesman want to alarm the buyer of possible service issues later on. What sells is the joy of electric propulsion that is clean, quiet and exhilarating. Taxpayer subsidies also help.\nBatteries have a defined life span and this is apparent with the decreasing runtime in our mobile phones. EV advocates may argue that a smartphone battery cannot be compared to an EV battery; these products are totally different. That is true, but ironically both use lithium-ion systems. This article looks at the battery in an EV and mobile phone in terms of runtime and longevity.\nThe battery in the mobile phone is consumer grade, optimized for maximum runtime at low cost. the EV battery, on the other hand, is made to industry standards with longevity in mind. The dissimilarities do not stop there and a key difference is how the energy is dispensed.\nA mobile phone gets charged at the end of a day and the stored energy can be fully utilized until the battery goes empty. In other words, the user has full access to the stored energy. When the battery is new, the phone provides good runtimes but this decreases with use. In this full cycle mode, Li-ion delivers about 500 cycles. The user adjusts to the decreasing runtime, and being a consumer product, the end of battery life often corresponds with a broken screen or the introduction of a new model. Built-in obsolescence serves well for device manufacturers and retailers.\nThe EV battery also ages and the capacity fades, but the EV manufacturer must guarantee the battery for eight years. This is done by oversizing the battery. When the battery is new, only about half of the available energy is utilized. This is done by charging the pack to only 80% instead of a full charge, and discharging to 30% when the available driving range is spent. As the battery fades, more of the battery storage is demanded. The driving range stays constant but unknown to the driver, the battery is gradually charged to a higher level and discharged deeper to compensate for the fade.\nOnce the battery capacity has dropped to 80%, the oversize protection is consumed and the battery maintenance system (BMS) applies a full charge and discharge. This exposes the EV battery to a similar stress level of a mobile phone and the driver begins noticing reduced driving range. Battery replacement may become necessary but the cost will be steep and higher than a combustion engine.\nThe EV begins to impersonate a mobile phone in terms of obsolescence when the battery fades. This may be the time when the buyer is flooded with faster and flashier models; something the smartphone user is all too familiar with, but price will be the shocker. It’s still too early to tell how long an EV battery will last. Some say the battery will outlive the car and find secondary application in energy storage systems.\nDriving habits and temperature also affects aging, a characteristic that came to light when EV batteries operating in a warm climate faded prematurely. It was learned that keeping a battery at elevated temperature and high state-of-charge causes more stress than aggressive driving. In other words, keeping a fully charged Li-ion at 30°C (86°F) and above hastens the aging process more than driving at a moderate temperature. Many EV batteries include liquid cooling to reduce heat-related battery fade.\nHarsh loading also reduces battery life. Because of its large size, the EV battery is only being stressed moderately, even during acceleration. In comparison, the mobile phone draws continuous high current from a small battery when transmitting and crunching data. This puts more stress on a mobile phone battery than driving an EV. A battery is also negatively impacted by the pulsed load of a mobile phone rather than the DC load of an EV. (See BU-501: Basic about Discharging.)\nThe EV does not disclose the battery capacity to the driver and only reveals state-of-charge (SoC) in the form of driving range. This is done in part for fear of customer complaints should the capacity drop below the mandated level at the end of the warranty period. Less knowledge is often better. The same restriction applies to a mobile phone battery, although access codes for service personnel are often available. A new battery has (should have) a capacity of 100%; 80% is the typical end of battery life.\nAll Li-ion batteries fade with time and use, whether in consumer products or enduring industrial use. Figure 3 explores the longevity of Li-ion batteries with different charge and discharge end points.\nLimiting a full charge and discharge prolongs battery life but lowers utilization.Source: ResearchGate – Modeling of Lithium-Ion Battery Degradation for Cell Life Assessment. ResearchGate is a social networking site for scientists and researchers founded in 2008 to share papers, ask and answer questions, and to find collaborators. Wikipedia https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303890624_Modeling_of_Lithium-Ion_Battery_Degradation_for_Cell_Life_Assessment\nThe Li-ion batteries in the above table perform well but the largest capacity loss occurs with the pack that is charged to 100% and discharged to 25% (black stars). Cycling between 85% and 25% (green) provides longer service life than charging to 100% and discharging to 50% (dark blue).\nThe lowest capacity loss occurs when charging Li-ion to 75% and discharging to 65%. This, however, takes oversizing to the extreme and the battery is underutilized. Such practice is applied in satellites to achieve high cycle life and less for terrestrial applications as it increases cost, size and weight beyond a reasonable point of return. The dynamic stress test does not include a battery that is charged to 100% and discharged to zero, as is the case with a mobile phone. A full cycle provides the best battery utilization but reduces longevity.\nBatteries tested in a laboratory do not always replicate true life conditions, and the results tend to be better than experienced in field use. In a lab environment, batteries are cycled over a period of a few months, often at controlled temperature and with an ideal charge and discharge regime. Random usage in real life adds the exposure to heat, vibration and harsh charging practices.\nBatteries do not have a fixed life span, nor do they die suddenly but fade gradually. Environmental conditions, and not cycling alone, govern longevity. The user has some control to prolong battery life by avoiding ultra-fast charges, operating at moderate temperature and avoiding full charges. Avoiding harsh loads and full discharges also helps. Heat is the enemy of most batteries and the worst condition is keeping a fully charged Li-ion battery at elevated temperatures. Even with the best of care, a battery only lives for a season and the pack will eventually face retirement when power fades.\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "title": "How to Improve the Battery Fuel Gauge",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/how-to-improve-the-battery-fuel-gauge",
        "content": "Most cottages in the countryside are heated by burning wood in a simple stone hearth. The desired heat is controlled by the feeding of wood. Today computers manage heating systems in large buildings and the boiler has become almost secondary. A similar trend is evolving with batteries. Increasingly, batteries are being controlled by a device called a Battery Management System (BMS).\nThe BMS assures safety, long life and provides state-of-charge (SoC). Current systems do this by measuring cell voltage, current and temperature, some also include coulomb counting. Coulomb counting measures the in-and out-flowing battery current, a theory that goes back 250 years. The accuracy of the SoC is good enough for consumer products and it decreases with use and time. By then the user has gotten used to the quirks of the device and no one gets hurt. Military, medical and other critical instruments demand higher accuracies and this article focuses on the intelligence responsible to measure battery SoC.\nThe challenge of the so-called “smart battery” is keeping the electrochemical battery and the digital battery together. The electrochemical battery is known as the actual energy storage vessel and the digital battery is the circuitry that predicts the remaining energy. Figure 1 illustrates the drifting apart of the digital battery from the electrochemical battery and how periodic calibration corrects the error. The values are assumed and accentuated.\nFigure 1: Tracking of Electrochemical and digital battery as a function of time\nWith use and time the electro-chemical and digital battery drift apart; calibration corrects the error. Note: The accumulating error is application related; the values on the chart are accentuated.\nAll batteries have losses and the released energy is always less than what has been fed into the pack. Inefficiencies in charge acceptance, especially towards the end of charge, resistive losses that turn into heat, and storage losses in the form of self-discharge reduce deliverable energy. A common flaw with BMS design is assuming that the battery will always stays young and energetic. Aging takes on many dimensions and some BMS compensate by observing user pattern and environmental conditions to derive a “learn” algorithm that is meant to correct the tracking error. Such modelling helps but there are limitations because battery aging cannot always be tracked accurately.\nCalibration, also known as capacity re-learning, is a better method to correct the tracking error of a smart battery. Manual calibration occurs by running the battery down on purpose. This can be done in the equipment or externally with a battery analyzer. With most fuel gauge chips, a full discharge resets the discharge flag and the subsequent recharge sets the charge flag. Establishing these two flags allows SoC calculation by tracking the distance between the flags. The calibration of a device in constant use should be done once every three months or after 40 partial cycles. If the device applies a periodic deep discharge on its own accord, no additional calibration is required. Such calibration is practical for a portable device but not an electrical powertrain or UPS.\nA device that often runs into calibration problems is a defibrillator. A defibrillator provides shock treatment to a patient suffering from a cardiac arrest. This medical instrument seldom reaches the full discharge needed for self-calibration, and applying a full charge alone is not sufficient. Nor does the SMBus help. SMBus provides communications and the results are only as good as the available data.\nNowhere is the accuracy of the battery fuel gauge more critical than in the electric powertrain. Surveys show that range anxiety is one of the largest concerns among EV buyers. A less known but equally worrisome impediment is inaccuracies in the battery fuel gauge. EV drivers have run out of battery power while the fuel gauge still indicated a comfortable 25 percent reserve. Getting stranded on account of false readings adds fear and paranoia. Anecdotal comments made by engineers at a SAE Consortium reveal that the SoC error of new EV battery modules can be as high as 15 percent.\nThe fuel gauge of the combustion engine does not have this problem. The storage tank stays the same for the life of the vehicle and the fuel dispensing remains accurate. The battery in the electric vehicle, on the other hand, shrinks and technology to measure dispensed energy needs improvement. People compare the battery with a fuel tank, but estimating storage capability and measuring battery energy from an electrochemical device is far more complex than with a liquid fuel storage system.\nThe BMS of an electric powertrain should also indicate the total energy a battery can hold at any given time. Accurate capacity measurements are not yet feasible and the losses are mostly hidden to the user. The battery capacity may have dropped to 80 percent, but the BMS will still show 100 percent SoC after a full charge. A lower capacity reduces the runtime and shortens driving range. A weak battery also charges more quickly because there is less to fill.\nA BMS should display SoC and SoH. But even if SoH were available, many manufacturers would be hesitant to show a capacity that is less that 100 percent during the warranty period for fear of customer complaint. The SoH of batteries in consumer products, as well as the electric powertrains could be made available to service personnel through coded access. To compensate for losses and honor the 8 to 10 year warranty, EV manufacturers oversize the battery by 20 percent. This allows for aging and offers extra driving range, just in case.\nBattery voltage, current and temperature alone are not sufficient to provide accurate SoC estimations, much less state-of-health (SoH). Early Li-ion correlated the rising internal resistance with SoH. This no longer works because most modern Li-ion batteries maintain low resistance as the battery ages.\nWhen designing a BMS, one also must consider how the battery serves the host. In an iPhone and most EVs, for example, the battery is “married” to the host. This enables collecting data for learning. The battery and device co-habitat in a similar way to partners in a good marriage. Batteries for two-way radio, on the other hand, are picked from a common charger and returned to a pool for recharging after use. Learning is difficult and a different method must be used to track battery health.\nCadex Electronics is making critical progress in measuring battery SoC with magnetism. Quantum magnetism (Q-Mag™) could provide the most accurate battery SoC readings ever achieved. Q-Mag™ makes use of the magnetic property relating to SoC, which changes as much as three-fold between empty and full charge on some battery systems. A coil generates an AC field and a sensor reads the magnetic susceptibility, which is linear to SoC.\nThere are several choices of sensors and because of availability and low price Cadex conducts the research with the GMR (Giant Magnetoresistance) sensor. It consists of ferromagnetic alloys that are sandwiched on an ultrathin nonmagnetic conducting layer. Applying a magnetic field lowers the resistance; removing the force increases it. The principle is known as electron scattering, which is also used on hard drive read/write heads. Figure 2 illustrates the function of a GMR sensor.\nFigure 2: GMR sensor\nThe magnetic property of a battery changes with SoC. A sensor reads the change when exposed to a magnetic field.\nQ-Mag™ has successfully been tested with Li-ion-cobalt, NMC, lithium iron phosphate, as well as several types of lead acid batteries. The system is immune to most outside interference and does not rely on voltage for SoC estimations. This allows reading SoC while the battery is on charge or a load. Q-Mag™ works with prismatic and cylindrical cells in aluminum and stainless steel casings, but not in ferrous material. The accuracy on lithium-based chemistries is +/-5%, lead acid is +/-7%. This high accuracy should be retained as the battery ages. Calibration occurs by applying a full charge.\nWith voltage and current references, Q-Mag™ is able to calculate SoC and SoH. The BMS can also detect micro-shorts by observing the self-discharge of a faulty cell, a feature that enhances battery safety. Furthermore, Q-Mag™ can be used for load leveling. This eliminates the rubber-band effect that complicates SoC estimations through voltage. Figure 3 shows Q-Mag as key contributor to BMS.\nFigure 3: Q-Mag serves asprimary BMS contributor\nQ-Mag simplifies the BMS and allows state-of-healthestimations on residentbatteries.\nQ-Mag can be made small and sandwiched between cells. A multi-cell battery may have one sensor for an overall assessment or several to enable diagnostics to cell level. An ASIC containing Q-Mag™ could also include temperature sensing and digital processing. At high volume, low price would make this technology available for big and small batteries, including consumer products. Displaying precise energy reserve, as is possible with a liquid fuel system, may be closer than we think.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Why do Different Test Methods Provide Dissimilar Readings?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/why-do-different-test-methods-provide-dissimilar-readings",
        "content": "During the last 20 years, three basic battery rapid test methods have emerged: DC load, AC conductance and multi-frequency electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). All methods are resistance based, a characteristic that reveals the battery's ability to deliver load current. Internal resistance provides useful information in detecting problems and indicating when a battery should be replaced. However, the battery often drops below the critical 80% level set by IEEE before the condition can effectively be detected. Neither does resistance alone provide a linear correlation to the battery's capacity. Rather, the increase of cell resistance relates to aging.\nWhen measuring the internal resistance of brand new VRLA cells from the same batch, variations of 8% between cells are common. Manufacturing process and materials used contribute to the discrepancies. Rather than relying on an absolute resistance reading, service technicians are asked to take a snapshot of the cell resistances when the battery is installed and then measure the subtle changes as the cells age. A 25% increase in resistance over the baseline indicates a performance drop from 100% to about 80%. Battery manufacturers honor warranty replacements if the internal resistance increases by 50%. Before analyzing the different test methods, let's briefly brush up on internal resistance and impedance, terms that are often used incorrectly when addressing the conductivity of a battery. Resistance is purely resistive and has no reactance. There is no trailing phase shift because the voltage and current are in unison. A heating element is such a pure resistive load. It works equally well with direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). Most electrical loads, including the battery, contain a component of reactance. The reactive part of the load varies with frequency. For example, the capacitive reactance of a capacitor decreases with rising frequency. A capacitor is an insulator to DC and no current can pass through. The inductor, on the other hand, acts in the opposite way and its reactance increases with rising frequency. DC presents an electrical short. A battery combines ohmic resistance, as well as capacitive and inductive reactance. The term impedance represents all three types. The battery may be viewed as a set of electrical elements. Figure 1 illustrates Randles' basic lead-acid battery model in terms of resistors and a capacitor (R1, R2 and C). The inductive reactance is commonly omitted because it plays a negligible role in a battery at low frequency.\nLet's now look at the different battery test methods and evaluate their strengths and limitations. It is important to know that each method provides a different internal resistance reading when measured on the same battery. Neither reading is right or wrong. For example, a cell may read higher resistance readings with the DC load method than with a 1000-hertz AC signal. This simply implies that the battery performs better on an AC than DC load. Manufacturers accept all variations as long as the readings are taken with the same type of instrument. DC load method: The pure ohmic measurement is one of the oldest and most reliable test methods. The instrument applies a load lasting a few seconds. The load current ranges from 25-70 amperes, depending on battery size. The drop in voltage divided by the current provides the resistance value. The readings are very accurate and repeatable. Manufacturers claim resistance readings in the 10 micro-ohm range. During the test, the unit heats up and some cooling will be needed between measurements on continuous use.\nAC conductance method: Instead of a DC load, the instrument injects an AC signal into the battery. A frequency of between 80-100 hertz is chosen to minimize the reactance. At this frequency, the inductive and capacitive reactance converges, resulting in a minimal voltage lag. Manufacturers of AC conductance equipment claim battery resistance readings to the 50 micro-ohm range. AC conductance gained momentum in 1992; the instruments are small and do not heat up during use.\nMulti-frequency electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS): Cadex Electronics has developed a rapid-test method based on EIS. Called Spectro™, the instrument injects 24 excitation frequencies ranging from 20-2000 Hertz. The sinusoidal signals are regulated at 10mV/cell to remain within the thermal battery voltage of lead acid. This allows consistent readings for small and large batteries..\nSpectro™ is the most complex of the three methods. The 20-second test processes 40 million transactions. The instrument is capable of reading to a very low micro-ohms level. With stored matrices as reference, Spectro™ is capable of providing battery capacity in Ah, conductivity (CCA) and state-of-charge.The EIS concept is not new. In the past, EIS systems were hooked up to dedicated computers and diverse laboratory equipment. Trained electrochemists were required to interpret the data. Advancements in data analysis automated this process and high-speed signal processors shrunk the technology into a handheld device.\nDC load and AC conductance have one major limitation in that these methods cannot measure capacity. With the growing demand of auxiliary power on cars and trucks and the need to assess performance of stationary batteries non-invasively, testers are needed that can estimate battery capacity. Cadex has succeeded in doing this with car batteries. The company is working on applying this technology to stationary batteries.Figure 5 reveals the reserve capacity (RC) readings of 24 car batteries, arranged from low to high on the horizontal axis. The batteries were first tested according to the SAE J537 standard, which includes a full charge, a rest period and a 25A discharge to 1.75V/cell during which the reserve capacity was measured (black diamonds). The tests were then repeated with Spectro™ (purple squares) using battery-specific matrices. The derived results approach laboratory standards, as the chart reveals\nSome people claim a close relationship between battery conductivity (ohmic values) and capacity. Others say that internal ohmic readings are of little practical use and have no relation to capacity. To demonstrate the relationship between resistance and capacity, Cadex Electronics has carried out an extensive test involving 175 automotive batteries in which the cold cranking amps (CCA) were compared with the RC readings. CCA represents the conductivity of the battery and is closely related with the internal resistance. Figure 6 shows the test results. The CCA readings are plotted on the vertical Y-axis and the RC on the horizontal X-axis. For ease of reading, the batteries are plotted as a percentage of their nominal value and are arranged from low-to-high on the X-axis.\nNote: The CCA and RC readings were obtained according to SAE J537 standards. CCA is defined as a discharge of a fully charged battery at -18°C at the CCA-rated current. If the voltage remains at or above 7.2V after 30 seconds, the battery passes. The RC is based on a full charge, rest period and a discharge at 25A to 1.75V/cell.If the internal resistance (CCA) were linear with capacity, then the blue diamonds would be in close proximity of the red reference line. In reality, CCA and RC wander off left and right. For example, the 90% CCA battery produces an RC of only 38%, whereas the 71% CCA delivers a whopping 112% capacity (green dotted line).\nCadex has packaged the EIS technology into an elegant hand-held tester that is currently being beta-tested in the USA, Canada, Europe and Japan. Being able to obtain battery capacity makes the EIS technology one of the most sought-after test systems for automotive, marine, aviation, defense, wheeled mobility, traction and UPS batteries. Capacity fading due to aging and other deficiencies can be tracked and a timely replacement scheduled.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-413: Charging with Solar, Turbine",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-413-charging-with-solar-turbine",
        "content": "Folks concerned about the environment gravitate towards using renewable energy. The sun provides peak power of about 1,000 watts per square meter (93W/sq ft) and a solar panel transforms this power into roughly 130W per square meter (12W/sq ft). This energy harvest corresponds to a clear day with the solar panel facing the sun. Surface dust on the solar panels and high heat reduce the overall efficiency.\nGenerating electricity by sunlight goes back to 1839 when Edmond Becquerel (1820–1891) first discovered the photovoltaic effect. It took another century before researchers understood the process on an atomic level, which works similar to a solid-state device with n-type and p-type silicon bonded together.\nCommercial photovoltaic (PV) systems are 10 to 20 percent efficient. Of these, the flexible panels are only in the 10 percent range and the solid panels are about 20 percent efficient. Multi-junction cell technologies are being tested that achieve efficiencies of 40 percent and higher.\nGlobal warming will affect solar panels negatively. A study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) reveals that a one degree Celsius increase in temperature reduces the photovoltaic power output by 0.45%. Like a battery, heat also reduces the lifespan of solar cells.\nAt 25°C (77°F), a high quality monocrystalline silicon solar panel produces about 0.60V open circuit (OCV). Like batteries, solar cells can be connected in series and parallel to get higher voltages and currents. (See BU-302: Series and Parallel Battery Configurations) The surface temperature in full sunlight will likely rise to 45°C (113°F) and higher, reducing the open circuit voltage to 0.55 V per cell due to lower efficiency. Solar cells become more efficient at low temperatures, but caution is necessary when charging batteries below freezing temperatures. (See BU-410: Charging at High and Low Temperatures) The internal resistance of a solar cell is relatively high: with a commercial cell, the series resistance is typically one ohm per square centimeter (1Ωcm2).\nA solar charging system is not complete without a charge controller. The charge controller takes the energy from the solar panels or wind turbine and converts the voltage so it’s suitable for battery charging. The supply voltage for a 12V battery bank is about 16V. This allows charging lead acid to 14.40V (6 x 2.40V/cell) and Li-ion to 12.60 (3 x 4.20V/cell). Note that 2.40V/cell for lead acid and 4.20V/cell for lithium-ion are the full-charge voltage thresholds.\nCharge controllers are also available for lithium-ion to charge 10.8V packs (3 cells in series). When acquiring a charge controller, observe the voltage requirements. The standard Li-ion family has a nominal voltage of 3.6V/cell; lithium iron phosphate is 3.20V/cell. Only connect the correct batteries for which the charge controller is designed. Do not connect a lead acid battery to a charge controller designed for Li-ion and vice-versa. This could compromise the safety and longevity of the batteries as the charge algorithms and voltage settings are different.\nA lower-cost charge controller only produces an output voltage when sufficient light is available. With a diminishing light source, the charge controller simply turns off and resumes when sufficient levels of light are restored. Most of these devices cannot utilize fringe power present at dawn and dusk and this limits them to applications with ideal lighting conditions.\nAn advanced charge controller tracks power by measuring the voltage and adjusting the current to get maximum power transfer with prevailing light conditions. This is made possible with maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Figure 1 illustrates the voltage and current source from a solar cell with varying sunlight. Optimal power is available at the voltage knee where the dropping voltage line meets the vertical power line. MPPT determines this point.\nMPPT finds the best power point which is at the crossing point of the vertical power line. (V x A = W). The top horizontal line gets the most light. Wind turbines have a lower internal resistance than PV and the MPPT differs.\nIt should be noted that not all MPPT circuits function equally well. Some are coarse and do not respond immediately to light changes, causing the output to fall or turn off if a shadow falls on the panel. Other systems drop off too early and do not fully utilize low light conditions.\nA common MPPT method is perturb and observe (P&O). The circuit increases the voltage by a small amount and measures power. If the power increases by the equal amount, further voltage increases are applied until the optimal setting is reached. P&O achieves good efficiency but it can be sluggish and result in oscillations.\nAnother method is incremental conductance that computes the maximum power point by comparing current and voltage deltas. This requires more computation but has an improved tracking ability over P&O. Current sweep is a method that observes the current and voltage characteristics of the PV array to calculate the maximum power point.\nSolar panels are normally connected in series, each providing about 20V on a sunny day. The controller reads the overall string voltage but if one panel gets shaded, the MPPT loses effectiveness. Advanced systems process each panel or group of panes individually. This allows voltage tracking of shaded panels down to 5V. The negative is higher system costs.\nYou may ask, “Why can I not simply plug a 12V solar panel directly into my laptop or mobile phone?” This should work in principle but is not recommended. The charge controller transforms the incoming DC voltage from the solar panel or wind turbine to the correct voltage range. In bright sunlight, the voltage of a 12V solar panel can go up to 40V, and this could damage your device.\nFrom 1998 to 2011, the price of commercial photovoltaic (PV) systems dropped by 5–7 percent annually and analysis suggests that the price-drop will continue. It now costs between US$4 and $5 per watt for a typical residential solar installation capable of delivering 5kW. Larger installations cost $3 to $4 per watt with further reductions for megawatt systems.\nA maintenance charger is usually powered by a small solar cell that provides a trickle charge to a battery on a sunny day. These devices help prevent sulfation of a lead acid battery when stored. Even a small float charge will keep the battery at full charge.\nChoose a maintenance charger that switches to a controlled float charge when the battery is fully charged. A prolonged charge, even at a low current, could overcharge the battery and promote internal corrosion. A float charge that is correctly adjusted only replenishes what the battery loses through self-discharge.

        "content": "Folks have been using rechargeable batteries for over 100 years but this marvelous power source is still poorly understood. The battery is a silent worker that delivers energy until it quits of exhaustion and old age. It is more prone to failure than most other parts in a system. Much is expected but little is given in return. With a shorter life span than the host device, battery replacement becomes an issue, and the “when” and “what if” are not well defined by the device manufacturer. Some batteries are replaced too soon but most stay too long.\nA portable system works well when the batteries are new but confidence drops after the first packs need replacing due to capacity fade. In time, the battery fleet becomes a jumble of good and bad batteries, and that’s when the headache begins. Battery management mandates that all batteries in a fleet are kept at an acceptable capacity level. Packs that fall below a given threshold must be replaced to keep system integrity. Battery failure occurs most often on a heavy traffic day or in an emergency when more than normal service is demanded.\nBatteries exhibit human-like qualities and need good nutrition. Care begins by operating at room temperate and discharging them at a moderate current. There is some truth as to why batteries cared for by an individual user outperform those in a fleet; studies can back this up.\nCharging is generally well understood, but the “ready” light is misconstrued. Ready does not mean “able.” There is no link to battery performance, nor does the green light promise full runtime. All batteries charge fully, even if weak; “ready” simply means that the battery is full.\nThe capacity a battery can hold diminishes with age and the charge time shortens with nickel-based batteries and in part also with lead acid, but not necessarily with Li-ion. Lower charge transfer capability that inhibits the flow of free electrons prolongs the charge time with aged Li-ion. (See BU-409a: Why do Old Li-ion Batteries Take Long to Charge?)\nA short charging time propels faded batteries to the top, disguised as combat ready. System collapse is imminent when workers scramble for freshly charged batteries in an emergency; those that are lit-up may be deadwood. (Note that the charge time of a partially charged battery is also shorter.) Figure 1 shows the “ready” light that is known to lie.\nThe READY light indicates that the battery is fully charged. This does not mean “able” as there is no link between “ready” and battery performance.\nThe amount of energy a battery can hold is measured in capacity. Capacity is the leading health indicator that determines runtime and predicts end of battery life when low. A new battery is rated at 100 percent, but few packs in service deliver the full amount: a workable capacity bandwidth is 80–100 percent. As a simple guideline, a battery on a two-way radio having a capacity of 100 percent would typically provide a runtime of 10 hours, 80 percent is 8 hours and 70 percent, 7 hours.\nThe service life of a battery is specified in number of cycles. Lithium- and nickel-based batteries deliver between 300 and 500 full discharge/charge cycles before the capacity drops below 80 percent.\nCycling is not the only cause of capacity loss; keeping a battery at elevated temperatures also induces stress. A fully charged Li-ion kept at 40°C (104°F) loses about 35 percent of its capacity in a year without being used(See BU:808: How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries). Ultra-fast chargers and harsh discharging is also harmful. This cuts battery life to half, and hobbyists can attest to this.\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/observing-batteries-in-everyday-life",
        "content": "Batteries have a mind of their own. They're stubborn and unpredictable behavior has left many battery users in awkward situations. And yet, the battery is our steady travel companion that allows us to carry out our activities disconnected from home and office. In this paper we observe the battery in personal use and fleet applications.\nIt is interesting to observe that batteries cared for by a single user generally last longer than those operating in an open fleet environment where everyone has access to but no one is accountable for them. A personal user is one who operates a mobile phone, a laptop or a video camera for pleasure or business. He or she will likely follow the recommended guidelines in caring for the battery. When the runtime gets low, the battery gets serviced or is replaced. Critical failures are rare because the owner adjusts to the performance of the battery and lowers the expectation as the battery ages.\nThe fleet user, on the other hand, has little personal interest in the battery and has no tolerance for a pack that is less than perfect. He simply grabs a battery from the charger and expects it to last through the shift. The battery is returned to the charger at the end of the day, ready for the next person. Regular battery maintenance is minimal and performance often starts to degrade after one year of service.How can fleet batteries be made to last longer? I examined the US and the Dutch Army, both of which use fleet batteries. The US Army issues batteries with no maintenance program. If the battery fails, another pack is released, no questions asked. Little or no care is given and the failure rate is high.The Dutch Army, on the other hand, has moved away from the open fleet system by making the soldiers responsible for their batteries. This change was made in an attempt to reduce operational costs and improve reliability. The batteries are issued to the soldiers and become part of their personal belongings. The results are startling. Since adapting this new regime, the failure rate has dropped considerably and the battery performance has increased. Unexpected down time has almost been eliminated.It should be noted that the Dutch Army uses exclusively nickel-cadmium batteries. Each pack receives periodic maintenance on a battery analyzer (Cadex) to prolong service life. Batteries that do not meet the 80% target capacity setting are reconditioned; those that fall below target are replaced. The US Army, on the other hand, uses nickel-metal-hydride, a battery that has higher energy density but is less durable. The US army is evaluating lithium-ion batteries for the next generation battery.\nBatteries get checked when they no longer hold charge or the equipment is sent in for repair. In an effort to improve reliability and cut replacement costs, many organizations have adapted some type of battery maintenance. A user may feel that his or her battery works adequately during routine days, not knowing that the pack holds only half the capacity. A system must be fit to operate in unforeseen circumstances and emergencies where every watt of battery power is needed. Breakdowns during these critical moments are all too common and weak batteries are often to blame. The loss of adequate battery power is as detrimental as any other malfunction in the system.I have recorded a number of stories in which lack of battery maintenance was evident:Fire brigade - A fire brigade had chronic communication problems with two-way radios. The problems were most acute during call-outs lasting two hours and longer. Although their radios functioned on receive, the transmissions broke up and the calls did not get through. The fire brigade acquired a battery analyzer (Cadex) and all batteries were serviced through exercise and recondition methods. Batteries that did not recover to a set target capacity were replaced.Shortly thereafter, the firefighters were summoned to a ten-hour call that demanded heavy radio traffic. To their astonishment, none of the radios failed. The success of this operation was credited to the good performance of their batteries. The following day, the captain of the fire brigade personally contacted the manufacturer of the battery analyzer and enthusiastically endorsed the use of the device.Emergency response - A Cadex representative was allowed to view the State Emergency Management Facility of a large US city. In the fortified underground bunker, 1400 batteries were kept in chargers. The green lights glowed, indicating that the batteries where ready at a moment's notice. The officer in charge stood erect and confidently said, \"We are prepared for any emergency\".The representative then asked the officer to hand over a battery to check the state-of-health. Within seconds, the battery analyzer detected a fail condition. In an effort to make good, the officer grabbed another battery from the charger but it failed too. Subsequent batteries also fell short.nickel-based batteries placed on prolonged standby become inoperable due to memory in as little a three months. Scenarios such as these are common. Political hurdles and lack of funding often stand in the way of a quick solution. The only thing the officer can do is pray that no emergency will occur.Army - Defense organizations take great pride in employing the highest quality and best performing equipment. When it comes to rechargeable batteries, however, there are exceptions. The battery often escapes the scrutiny of a full military inspection and only its visual appearance is checked. Maintenance is frequently ignored and little effort is made in keeping track of the battery's state of health, cycle count and age. In time, the soldiers begin carrying rocks instead of batteries.\nBatteries fooled the British Army during the Falkland War in 1982. The army assumed that a battery would always follow the rigid military specifications, even after long neglect. Not so. When the order was given to launch the portable missiles, nothing happened and the missiles did not fly that day. The batteries were dead.Government services - An organization continually experienced failures with nickel-cadmium batteries. Although the batteries performed at 100% when new, the capacity dropped to 20% and lower in only one year. We discovered that their two-way radios were under-utilized; yet the batteries received a full recharge after each short field use.After replacing the batteries, we advised the organization to exercise the batteries once per month through a full discharge. The first exercise occurred only after four month of service. Here is what we found:The capacity on half of the batteries had dropped to 70-75%. With exercise and recondition (deep cycle), all batteries were fully restored (100%). Had maintenance been omitted for much longer, the probability of a full recovery would have been jeopardized.Construction - I noticed fewer battery problems on two-way radios with construction workers than security guards. The construction workers often did not bother turning off their two-way radios at the end of the shift. As a result, the nickel-cadmium batteries got their needed exercise and kept performing until they fell apart from old age, often held together with duct tape.In comparison, the security guards pampered their batteries to death by giving them light duty and plenty of recharge. These batteries still looked new when they had to be discarded after only 12 months of service. Because of the advanced memory, recondition was no longer effective.Memory only occurs on nickel-based batteries, a phenomenon that can be corrected with periodic discharge cycles.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/what-everyone-should-know-about-battery-chargers",
        "content": "A good charger provides the base for well-performing and durable batteries. In a price-competitive market chargers often receive low priority. The battery and charger must go together like horse and carriage (Figure 1), and this is not always the case. Engineers are often not fully aware of the complex power requirement of a portable device and the need to charge under adverse conditions.\nChargers are divided into personal and industrial, “smart” and “dumb,” slow, fast and ultra-fast types. Consumer products come with a low-cost personal charger that performs well when used as directed. The industrial charger is often made by a third party and includes special features, such as charging at adverse temperatures. Although batteries operate below freezing, not all chemistries can be charged when cold and most Li-ion falls into this category. Lead and nickel-based batteries accept charge but at a lower rate.Some Li-ion chargers (Cadex) include a wake-up feature, or “boost,” to allow recharging if a Li-ion battery have fallen asleep due to over-discharge. A sleep condition can occur when storing the battery in a discharged state and the self-discharge brings the voltage to the cut-off point. A regular charger treats such a battery as unserviceable and the packs are discarded. Boost applies a small charge current to raise the voltage to between 2.20 and 2.90V/cell and activate the protection circuit, at which point a normal charge commences. Caution applies if Li-ion has dwelled below 1.5V/cell for a week or longer.Lead- and lithium-based chargers operate on Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) by which the voltage is capped when reaching a set limit. At this point of the charge cycle, the battery begins to saturate and the current drops. Full-charge occurs when the current drops to a set level. Lead acid requires a periodic full saturation to prevent sulfation.Nickel-based batteries charge with constant current and the voltage is allowed to fluctuate freely. This can be compared to lifting a weight with an elastic band where the hand moves ahead of the load. Full charge detection occurs when observing a slight voltage drop after a steady rise. This method is known as the Delta Voltage Delta Temperature (DVDT) and works well with rapid and fast charge. To safeguard against anomalies, such as shorted or mismatched cells, the charger should include a plateau timer to terminate charge if no voltage delta is measured, as well as a temperature sensors.A temperature rise is normal with nickel-based batteries, especially when reaching the 70 percent charge level. The reason for this is a decrease in charge efficiency and the charge current should be lowered to limit stress. When “ready,” the battery must cool down. If the temperature stays above ambient, then the charger is not performing right and the battery should be removed. Extended trickle charge on nickel-based batteries inflicts damage. NiCd and NiMH should not be left in the charger unattended for weeks and months. If not required, store them in a cool place and apply a charge before engagement.Lithium-based should always stay cool on charge. Discontinue using the battery and/or charger if the battery heats up on charge. Li ion cannot absorb over-charge and therefore does not receive trickle charge when full. It is not necessary to remove Li-ion from the charger, however, if not used for a week or more, it is always best to place the pack in a cool place and recharge before use.The most basic charger is the overnight charger, also known as slow charger. This goes back to the old nickel-cadmium days where a simple charger applied a fixed charge of about 0.1C (one-tenth of the rated capacity) as long as the battery was connected. Slow chargers have no full-charge detection; the charge stays engaged and a full charge of an empty battery takes 14–16 hours. When fully charged, the slow charger keeps NiCd lukewarm to the touch. Because of its reduced ability to absorb over-charge, NiMH should not be charged on a slow charger. Low-cost consumer chargers to charge C AA and AAA cells often use this charger method, so do some children’s toys.The rapid charger falls between the slow and fast charger and is used in consumer products. The charge time of an empty pack is 3–6. When full, the charger switches to “ready.” Most rapid chargers include temperature sensing to safely charge a faulty battery.The fast charger offers several advantages and the obvious one is shorter charge times. Short charge times demand tighter communication between the charger and battery. At a charge rate of 1C, which the fast charger typically uses, an empty NiCd and NiMH charges in a little more than an hour. As the battery approaches full charge, some nickel-based chargers reduce the current to adjust to the lower charge acceptance. The fully charged battery switches to trickle charge, also known as maintenance charge. Most of today’s nickel-based chargers have a reduced trickle charge to also accommodate NiMH.Li-ion charges are most efficient and charge the battery to 70 percent in less than an hour. The extra time is devoted for the long saturation charge that is not mandatory as it is for lead acid. In fact, it is better not to fully charge Li-ion as it will last longer. Of all chargers, the Li-ion charger is the most simplistic. No trickery applies to improve battery performance and longevity. Only the CCCV method works. Lead acid cannot be fast-charged and the term “fast-charge” is a misnomer. Most lead acid chargers charge the battery in 14–16 hours; anything slower is a compromise. Lead acid can be charged to 70 percent in about eight hours; the all-important saturation charge takes up the remaining time. A partial charge is fine provided the lead acid occasionally receives a fully saturated charge to prevent sulfation.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Isidor Buchmann, founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics, recognized the high failure rate of nickel-cadmium batteries in portable devices and developed a battery analyzer that would exercise and rejuvenate these rechargeable batteries. He ran his business in a small room in his residence under the name Buchmann Enterprises Inc. After receiving the registered Cadex trademark, he changed the company name to Cadex Electronics Inc. in 1985. Cadex is derived from “CADmium-EXerciser.”\nThe first battery analyzer introduced in 1981 failed to achieve the anticipated market acceptance and only a few of the Cadex 450 were sold. The setback did not discourage Isidor, and he started to design a modular battery analyzer that could simultaneously service different battery types. The resulting Cadex 550 battery analyzer sold reasonably well and became the workhorse for two-way radio batteries serving the public safety, railway and oil industries. In 1983, the company moved from Isidor’s home address to a rented office.\nIn 1985, a communications company commissioned Cadex to develop and manufacture an intelligent fast-charger for the End-of-Train Unit. The device clamps to the last car of a freight train and replaces the caboose by providing vital operating information such as brake pressure and car-in-motion data. The successful project formed the foundation for several new Cadex products that were assisted with research funds from the Science Council of British Columbia and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC).\nThe charger design led to the development of a fully programmable battery analyzer in 1991 that benefited from the rapidly growing mobile phone market. In 1995, the Cadex C7000 Series with the SnapLock™ battery adapter system established a new standard to which competitive products were compared. This opened markets in public safety, defense, healthcare, transportation, logistics and mining in over 100 countries, resulting double-digit growth for several years.\nAs Cadex grew, the company needed relocating to larger premises. Doubling plant size with each move made the new location look empty at first. Items that were within arm’s reach now needed long-distance running. Eventually, employees and equipment filled in the void and the hum of activity replaced the echoing sound resembling an empty hall.\nIsidor felt proud walking down the long corridors with offices to the left and right, filled with dedicated staff serving customers and taking orders. During this period of rapid growth, Cadex received contracts from a U.S. defense organization and a leading medical company to supply battery chargers and analyzers for defibrillators. Business organizations took notice of this rising company and Isidor was a finalist at four Entrepreneur of the Year events.\nCadex reached financial strength to build its own headquarters and acquired one of the most scenic parcels of land in a new industrial park in Richmond, BC. Architects drew up plans and Isidor spent several months optimizing the floor layout and enhancing the appearance.\nThe building includes a large two-story glass octagon that serves as entrance lobby and accommodates the reception and meeting rooms. A broad staircase leading to the second floor conveys an atmosphere of grandeur and space. Large windows and balconies facing the mighty Fraser River, on which the building is located, provide a relaxing show of swans frolicking in the waters and ducks grazing on the riverbanks. This tranquil setting central to metropolitan Vancouver provides a pleasant working environment and promotes creative thinking.\nEveryone with an idea and a little bit of savings can start a company. This turns Karl Marx’s famous dictum on its head that imposed layers of permissions, secure access to capital, a plant filled with machinery and ready buyers to consume the products it produced. What is needed more than ever is a vision and the discipline to slug it out even when the first attempt goes bust. Once the products are accepted, continued improvements must be made together with attentive customer service. Products may fail in the field, but how quickly these problems are being solved measures the success. And, yes, don’t forget sacrifice. The owners must become the servants who continuously hunt for the greatest talents in the land.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-806-tracking-battery-capacity-and-resistance-as-part-of-aging",
        "content": "All batteries age and the effects manifest themselves in diminished capacity, increased internal resistance and elevated self-discharge. A new battery (Figure 1) delivers (or should deliver) 100 percent capacity; an aged unit (Figure 2) may hold only 20 percent. In our example, the capacity loss is illustrated by placing rocks in the container.\nFigure 1: New Battery has 100% capacity [1]\nCapacity is represented by a liquid with no obstruction. The battery delivers full runtime.\nFigure 2: Faded Battery [1]\nCapacity loss is illustrated as “rock-content.” The battery behaves normally but it has a short runtime, even if fully charged.\nAutomotive technicians are most familiar with CCA (cold cranking amps) in relation to turn the engine. CCA relates to the internal battery resistance and the ability to deliver high load current. Figure 3 illustrates a starter battery with high CCA and an open tap symbolizing delivering full power; Figure 4 has elevated internal resistance that limits the current delivery to a trickle.\nFigure 3: Low internal resistance enables high current [1]\nCranking current on a starter battery is 300A; a golf car draws 56A\nFigure 4: Battery with low CCA [1]\nRising internal resistance inhibits power delivery. This is less common as capacity fade occurs first.\nRechargeable batteries have improved and maintain low internal resistance during most of the service life; an increase in internal resistance may only occur towards the very end. Starter batteries keep a high CCA and provide healthy cranking to the end, but the capacity gradually drops without sign. An analogy is a galloping horse that keeps its spirited performance until its eventual collapse from exhaustion. Figure 5 demonstrates the relationship of capacity and CCA of 20 aging starter batteries, sorted according to capacity(See also BU-905a: Testing Starter Batteries in Vehicles)\nBatteries 1–9 have good CCA and high capacity; the CCA of batteries 10–20 still enables good cranking, but the batteries have large capacity loss. CCA tends to remain high while the capacity drops with aging. Test method: CCA was estimated with the Spectro CA-12 and the capacity was measured with an Agilent load bank by applying full discharges according to BCI standards.\nBatteries 1–9 perform well on capacity and CCA, but batteries 10–20 show notable capacity loss while maintaining acceptable CCA performance. Capacity depletion eventually disables the cranking. This is mostly evident during cold spells, which further reduce the capacity.\nCar manufacturers often use 65 percent as the pass/fail threshold for warranty replacement while service garages take 40 percent as an end-of-life indication(See BU-904: How to Measure Capacity) Forty percent should give another 6–12 months of service, but below this is cause for concern and the battery should be replaced even though the cranking is still good. Thrifty drivers (including the author), prefer to wait but invariably get caught with a dead battery at the worst possible moment.\nTo study the correlation between capacity and internal resistance, Cadex tested 175 aging starter batteries by measuring the CCA and capacity according to SAE J537. In this lengthy test, Cadex found that the correlation between capacity and CCA is only 0.55 (1 would be a perfect match). This led to the development of capacity estimation technology, as relying on the internal resistance, or CCA on a starter battery is unreliable. Figure 6 demonstrates the aging trend of starter batteries as a function of capacity and CCA(See BU-1101: Glossary under SAE J537)\nBatteries in the green PASS field are functional; the red FAIL field denotes breakdown. Most batteries exit life through the 40% capacity line at the left field; few slip through the 50% CCA line. Test method: Capacity and CCA were tested accoding to SAE J537.\nThe horizontal X-axis represents capacity; the vertical Y-axis shows CCA; the stars are the 175 batteries tested. The arrow shows the typical aging trend of batteries passing through the “Capacity Line” on the left PASS field. Very few batteries slip through the “CCA Line.”\nThis demonstrates that starter batteries fail mainly due to capacity fade rather than low CCA or elevated internal resistance. This characteristic is visible with most lead- and lithium-based batteries. A capacity measurement is more meaningful than measuring the internal resistance, but estimating capacity on the fly involves higher complexities than simply taking an ohmic reading.\n[1]Courtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Capacity-fade of nickel-based batteries correlates, in part, with a rise in internal resistance. NiCd and NiMH share similarities with lead- and lithium-based batteries in that the internal resistance remains low at first and then rapidly increases towards the end of life. Measuring resistance could serve as a simple rapid-test method to detect end-of-life but this would not provide dependable state-of-health (SoH) information(See BU-208: Cycling Performance)\nQuickTest™ (by Cadex) goes deeper than mere resistance measurements and fuses data from six variables. These are capacity, internal resistance, self-discharge, charge acceptance, discharge capabilities and mobility of electrolyte. A trend-learning algorithm combines the data to provide a dependable state-of-health (SoH) reading in percentage. The system uses battery-specific matrices that are stored in the test device. Figure 1 illustrates a simplified structure of the algorithm.\nMultiple variables are fed to the micro controller, “‘fuzzified” and processed by parallel logic. The data is averaged and weighted according to battery application.\nAs QuickTest™ includes the internal resistance of a battery pack, the welding joints between the cells must be taken into consideration, especially with packs of 10 cells or more. Although seemingly insignificant in terms of added resistance, the mechanical linkage behaves differently to the chemical cell and this causes an unwanted error. The linkage error is not seen on a conventional discharge test or when doing only a resistance check but it interferes with higher end rapid-test methods involving excitation signals that look at many variables.\nIn addition to the resistance of interlinking cells, each cell in a multi-cell pack responds differently to the excitation signals. As the pack ages, these characteristics begin to diverge; QuickTest™ looks at the average of all cells combined. QuickTest™ only works effectively with nickel-based batteries, Li-ion and lead acid systems uses different rapid-test technologies(See BU-907: Testing Lithium-based Batteries)\n[1] J.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-309-how-does-graphite-work-in-li-ion",
        "content": "In 2015, the media predicted heavy demand for graphite to satisfy the growth of Li-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. Speculation arose that graphite could be in short supply because a large EV battery requires about 25kg (55 lb) of graphite for the Li-ion anode. Although price and consumption has been lackluster, there are indications that the demand is tightening. China is the main producer of anode material.\nFigure 1: Natural Graphite Production (2023)\nSource: BMO Capital Markets, USGS 2024 Mineral Commodity Summary\nProducing anode-grade graphite with 99.99 percent purity is expensive and the process creates waste. The end-cost is not so much the material but the purification process. Recycling old Li-ion to retrieve graphite will not solve this because of the tedious purification process.\nCarbon and graphite are related substances. Graphite is an allotrope of carbon, a structural modification that occurs by bonding the elements together in a different manner. Graphite is the most stable form of carbon. The diamond, a metastable allotrope of carbon known for its excellent physical qualities, is less stable than graphite; yet graphite is soft and malleable.\nGraphite comes from the Greek word “graphein.” It is heat-resistant, electrically and thermally conductive, chemically passive (corrosion-resistant) and lighter than aluminum. Beside Li-ion anodes, high-grade graphite is also used in fuel cells, solar cells, semiconductors, LEDs, and nuclear reactors.\nA carbon fiber is a long, thin strand of about 5–10µm in diameter, one-tenth the thickness of a human hair. The carbon atoms are bonded together in microscopic crystals and are extremely strong. They are woven in a textile fashion and mixed with a polymer matrix, which is a hardened form of carbon fiber that is as strong as steel but lighter. These materials are used in golf clubs and bicycle frames, as well as body parts for cars and airplanes to replace aluminum. The Boeing 787 and Airbus 350X make extensive use of carbon fiber. Graphite for batteries currently accounts to only 5 percent of the global demand.\nGraphite comes in two forms: natural graphite from mines and synthetic graphite from petroleum coke. Both types are used for Li-ion anode material with 55 percent gravitating towards synthetic and the balance to natural graphite.\nManufacturers preferred synthetic graphite because of its superior consistency and purity to natural graphite. This is changing and with modern chemical purification processes and thermal treatment, natural graphite achieves a purity of 99.9 percent compared to 99.0 percent for the synthetic equivalent.\nPurified natural flake graphite has a higher crystalline structure and offers better electrical and thermal conductivity than synthetic material. Switching to natural graphite will lower production cost with same or better Li-ion performance. Synthetic graphite for Li-ion sells for around US $10,000 per ton whereas spherical graphite made from natural flake sells for US $7,000 (2015 prices).\nUnprocessed natural graphite is much cheaper, and besides cost, natural graphite is more environmentally friendly than synthetic graphite; it also forms the base for graphene, a scientist’s dream. At the end of 2016, natural graphite accounts for 60-65% of the market share; synthetic is around 30% and alternatives such as lithium titanate, silicon and tin is around 5%.\nA research lab reports improvements in cycle life using artificial graphite. Artificial graphite is similar to synthetic graphic but cost and manufacturability are not yet known. Test results released in 2019 reveal notable improvements in cycle life, an issue that is of large interest for the electric vehicle.\nEnvironmental Concerns: The graphite industry is under pressure to reduce pollution levels. Processing natural flake graphite and synthetic graphite can contaminate the air with dangerous particles in the proximity of the plant. Reducing wastewater born by processing natural flake graphite into spherical graphite as part of purification is also a concern.\nSpherical graphite is mainly refined from flake graphite reaching purity of 99.95%. With a rapid growth of Li-ion demand over the next decade, questions arise on the ability to supply enough spherical graphite to meet the demand. Spherical graphite costs 3-4 more than small- to medium-sized flake concentrate. Part of this cost is born by stringent environmental requirements because the refinement process uses strong acids.\nThese graphite materials are almost exclusively used for anodes in Li-ion batteries. India and China are large produces of graphite. As Li-ion improves, processes become more complex and this also involves environmental protection. (See BU-1002b: Environmental Benefit of the Electric Powertrain)\nCurrent purification processes are mainly done in China and require a large quantity of chemicals that have a negative environmental impact. In the near future, purification can be done with new green technology, such as hydroelectricity.\nWhile efforts are made to ease the environmental impact, supply is constrained for both the natural and synthetic graphite. This holdback reflects in the price of graphite material that started in 2017 and is expected to hold into 2020 as plants are being refurbished.\nGraphene is an allotrope of carbon in the form of a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice. Presented in a sheet of pure carbon, graphene is only one atom thick. It is flexible, transparent, impermeable to moisture, stronger than diamonds and more conductive than gold. Experts hint to graphene as a miracle material that will improve many products, including the battery.\nGraphene anodes are said to hold energy better than graphite anodes and promise a charge time that is ten times faster than what is currently possible with Li-ion. Load capabilities should also improve; better longevity is another item on the wish-list that needs to be proven.\nWith traditional graphite anodes, lithium ions accumulate around the outer surface of the anode. Graphene has a more elegant solution by enabling lithium ions to pass through the tiny holes of the graphene sheets measuring 10–20nm. This promises optimal storage area and easy extraction. Once available, such a battery is estimated to store ten times more energy than Li-ion featuring regular graphite anodes.\nFurther improvements with graphene are achieved by adding vanadium oxide to the cathode. Experimental batteries with such an enhancement are said to recharge in 20 seconds and retain 90 percent capacity after 1,000 cycles. Graphene is also being tested in supercapacitors to improve the specific energy density, as well as in solar cells. Figure 1 illustrates the unique lattice of graphene made visible with scanning probe microscopy (SPM).\nGraphene is a sheet of pure carbon that is one atom thick. It is flexible, transparent, impermeable to moisture, stronger than diamonds and more conductive than gold. Each carbon atom possesses three electrons that bind with the nearest neighbor atom electron, creating a chemical bond.\nScientists have theorized about the wonders of graphene for decades, but no commercial products exist that makes exclusive use of this apparent miracle material. It is likely that the marvel of graphene has been utilized unknowingly for centuries in pencils and other products. A better understanding of its mechanism will eventually lead to improved products.\nMeanwhile we take the many wonderful breakthroughs published by academia and stock promoters with a grain of salt. We will embrace the super battery when it arrives but pledge to honor what we currently have by taking better care of it in the workforce.

        "title": "How does Internal Resistance affect Performance?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/how-does-internal-resistance-affect-performance",
        "content": "With the move from analog to digital, new demands are placed on the battery. Unlike analog portable devices that draw a steady current, the digital equipment loads the battery with short, heavy current spikes.\nOne of the urgent requirements of a battery for digital applications is low internal resistance. Measured in milliohms, the internal resistance is the gatekeeper that, to a large extent, determines the runtime. The lower the resistance, the less restriction the battery encounters in delivering the needed power spikes. A high mW reading can trigger an early 'low battery' indication on a seemingly good battery because the available energy cannot be delivered in the required manner and remains in the battery\nFigure 1 demonstrates the voltage signature and corresponding runtime of a battery with low, medium and high internal resistance when connected to a digital load. Similar to a soft ball that easily deforms when squeezed, the voltage of a battery with high internal resistance modulates the supply voltage and leaves dips, reflecting the load pulses. These pulses push the voltage towards the end-of-discharge line, resulting in a premature cut-off. As seen in the chart, the internal resistance governs much of the runtime.\nAs part of ongoing research to measure the runtime of batteries with various internal resistance levels, Cadex Electronics examined several cell phone batteries that had been in service for a while. All batteries were similar in size and generated good capacity readings when checked with a battery analyzer under a steady discharge load. The nickel-cadmium pack produced a capacity of 113%, nickel-metal-hydride checked in at 107% and the lithium-ion provided 94%. The internal resistance varied widely and measured a low 155 mOhm for nickel-cadmium, a high 778 mOhm for nickel-metal-hydride and a moderate 320 mOhm for lithium-ion. These internal resistance readings are typical of aging batteries with these chemistries.\nLet's now check how the test batteries perform on a cell phone. The maximum pulse current of a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) cell phones is 2.5 amperes. This represents a large current from a relatively small battery of about 800 milliampere (mAh) hours. A current pulse of 2.4 amperes from an 800 mAh battery, for example, correspond to a C-rate of 3C. This is three times the current rating of the battery. Such high current pulses can only be delivered if the internal battery resistance is low.\nFigures 2, 3 and 4 reveal the talk time of the three batteries under a simulated GSM current of 1C, 2C and 3C. One can see a direct relationship between the battery's internal resistance and the talk time. nickel-cadmium performed best under the circumstances and provided a talk time of 120 minutes at a 3C discharge (orange line). nickel-metal-hydride performed only at 1C (blue line) and failed at 3C. lithium-ion allowed a moderate 50 minutes talk time at 3C.\nThe internal resistance varies with the state-of-charge of the battery. The largest changes are noticeable on nickel-based batteries. In Figure 5, we observe the internal resistance of nickel-metal-hydride when empty, during charge, at full charge and after a 4-hour rest period.\nThe resistance levels are highest at low state-of-charge and immediately after charging. Contrary to popular belief, the best battery performance is not achieved immediately after a full charge but following a rest period of a few hours. During discharge, the internal battery resistance decreases, reaches the lowest point at half charge and starts creeping up again (dotted line).\nThe internal resistance of lithium-ion is fairly flat from empty to full charge. The battery decreases asymptotically from 270 mW at 0% to 250 mW at 70% state-of-charge. The largest changes occur between 0% and 30% SoC.\nThe resistance of lead acid goes up with discharge. This change is caused by the decrease of the specific gravity, a depletion of the electrolyte as it becomes more watery. The resistance increase is almost linear with the decrease of the specific gravity. A rest of a few hours will partially restore the battery as the sulphate ions can replenish themselves. The resistance change between full charge and discharge is about 40%. Cold temperature increases the internal resistance on all batteries and adds about 50% between +30°C and -18°C to lead acid batteries. Figure 6 reveals the increase of the internal resistance of a gelled lead acid battery used for wheelchairs.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

We like to hear from you but we cannot answer all inquiries. We recommend posting your question in the comment sections for the Battery University Group (BUG) to share.\nWould it be possible to send short 1 second current bursts at C/4 and then switch off the charge current for 0,1 sec during which I measure the true internal cell voltage without any current flow through the internal resistance interfering with the true internal voltage reading of the cell. If this voltage reads 4,1 volts or whatever the terminal voltage is needed then the current bursts stop. In this way I see it should be possible to charge the cell faster without the internal resistance causing the charging current to taper off at the end. As you know most common chargers have a set end voltage which is the reason for the tapering charge current. Using the pulse charging method I do realise that with the internal resistance, the voltage across the cell will end up higher than the 4,1 volts especially with an old cell or low quality cell of high internal resistance. This is due to the same C/4 current across the internal resistance causing a voltage drop internally plus the true internal cell voltage.  The question is, will it be safe as the true internal voltage of the cell will still be below the 4,1 volt until the off charge voltage measures 4,1 volts which is where it stops charging. In my tests I have seen voltages of 4,7 volts in the 1 sec bursts due to the poor cells tested on, yet the terminal off charge voltage it 4,1 volts. The circuit works and none of the cells have blown up so far but my question is am I being dangerous?\nyou didnt have to bugg me about it or did you.\nI can see the pics, may be there is something wrong with the site?\nComments from the previous website are not compatible with our new commenting system but we have preserved them so our users can still reference and make use the information in them.\nThe material on Battery University is based on the indispensable new 4th edition of \"Batteries in a Portable World - A Handbook on Rechargeable Batteries for Non-Engineers\" which is available for order through Amazon.com.\nBuy On Amazon"

        "title": "BU-705: How to Recycle Batteries",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-705-how-to-recycle-batteries",
        "content": "Lead- and cadmium-based batteries pose the largest environmental concerns, so much so that nickel-cadmium was banned in Europe in 2009. Attempts are being made to also ban the lead-based battery, but no suitable replacement is available as was the case by substituting nickel-cadmium with nickel-metal-hydride. For the first time, lithium-ion has been added to the list of pollutants. This chemistry was classified as only mildly toxic, but their sheer volume requires tighter scrutiny.\nLead acid paved the way to the success of recycling, and today more than 97 percent of these batteries are recycled in the USA. The automotive industry should be given credit for having organized recycling early; however, business reasons rather than environmental concerns may have been the driving force. The recycling process is simple and 70 percent of the battery’s weight is reusable lead.\nOver 50 percent of the lead supply comes from recycled batteries. Other battery types are not as economical to recycle and are not being returned as readily as lead acid. Several organizations are working on programs to make the collection of all batteries convenient. Only 20 to 40 percent of batteries in mobile phones and other consumer products are currently recycled. The goal of recycling is to prevent hazardous materials from entering landfills and to utilize the retrieved materials in the fabrication of new products.\nSpent batteries should be removed from the household. Old primary cells are known to leak and cause damage to the surrounding area. Do not store old lead acid batteries where children play. Simply touching the lead poles can be harmful. Also, keep button cells hidden from small children as they can swallow these batteries. (See BU-703: Health Concerns with Batteries)\nEven though environmentally unfriendly, lead acid batteries continue to hold a strong market niche, especially as a starter battery. Wheeled mobility and UPS systems could not run as economically if it were not for this reliable battery. NiCd also continues to hold a critical position among rechargeable batteries as large flooded NiCds start jet airplanes and propel sightseeing boats in rivers of larger cities. Although pollution-free, these batteries are in decline.\nBatteries with toxic substances will continue to be with us and there is nothing wrong in using them as long as they are being disposed of properly. Each battery chemistry has its own recycling procedure and the process begins by sorting the batteries into the correct categories.\nLead Acid: Recycling of lead acid began with the introduction of the starter battery in 1912. The process is simple and cost-effective as lead is easy to extract and can be reused multiple times. This led to many profitable businesses and the recycling of other batteries.\nIn late 2013, smelters started to report an increased number of Li-ion batteries being mixed in with lead acid, especially in starter batteries. This can cause fires, leading to explosion and personal injury. The physical appearance of lead acid and Li-ion packs are similar and sorting at high volume poses a challenge. For consumers, a battery is a battery and folks are enticed to recycle all batteries, never mind the chemistry. As more lead acid are being replaced with Li-ion, the problem will only escalate. From 2010–2013, there has been a 10-fold increase in reported incidents of infiltration of Li-ion with lead acid.\nPlease note that Li-ion is more volatile when stripped than lead acid. Presorting is done for safety reasons and not to separate hazardous material. Lead acid is benign but toxic, Li-ion is non-malignant but explosive.\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) initiate action through increased awareness, employee training, battery identification and labeling. X-ray technologies to separate batteries are being explored and “who carries the liability?” is being asked. Battery manufacturers put the responsibility on the recyclers who in turn argue that the burden and sustainability of a product must be borne by the manufacturer. The courts may become the arbitrators.\nNickel-cadmium: When NiCd batteries are disposed of carelessly, the metallic cell cylinder eventually corrode in the landfill. Cadmium dissolves and seeps into the water supply. Once contamination begins, authorities are helpless to stop the carnage. Our oceans already show traces of cadmium (along with aspirin, penicillin and antidepressants) but scientists are not certain of its origin.\nNickel-metal-hydride: Nickel and the electrolyte in NiMH are semi-toxic. If no disposal service is available in an area, individual NiMH batteries can be discarded with other household waste in small quantities; however, with 10 or more batteries, the user should consider disposal them in a secure waste landfill. The better alternative is taking the spent batteries to a neighborhood drop-off bin for recycling.\nPrimary Lithium: These batteries contain metallic lithium that reacts violently when in contact with moisture and must be disposed of appropriately. If thrown in a landfill in a charged state, heavy equipment operating on top could crush the cases and the exposed lithium could ignite a fire. Landfill fires are difficult to extinguish and can burn for years underground. Before recycling, apply a full discharge to consume the lithium content. Primary lithium batteries (lithium-metal) are used in military combat, as well as in watches, sensors, hearing aids and memory backup. A lithium-metal variety also serves as alkaline replacement in AAA, AA and 9V formats. Li-ion for mobile phones and laptops do not contain metallic lithium. (See also BU-106: Advantages of Primary Batteries)\nLithium-ion: Li-ion is reasonably harmless but spent packs should be disposed of properly. This is done less to retrieve valuable metals, as is the case with lead acid, than for environmental reasons, especially with the growing volume used in consumer products. Li-ion contains harmful elements that are at the toxicity level of electronic devices.\nWith the increasing use of Li-ion, the European Commission report named “Towards the Battery of the future” delivers warnings because of the large number of batteries that will meet end-of-life. In Europe, Li-ion cannot be landfilled because of toxicity and danger of explosion, nor can they be incinerated as the ashes are also toxic in landfill. Of concern is cobalt and agents that bind electrode materials together.\nThe report no longer brands lead acid as the most toxic battery. Lead acid is the only battery that can be recycled profitably. With almost 100% of lead acid being recycled, the focus shifts to Li-ion because of growing volume and value of retrievable materials.\nAccording to an ATZ report (2018), the 33kWh Li-ion traction battery of the BMW i3 electric vehicle contains 2kg (4.4 lb) cobalt, 6kg (13 lb) lithium, 12kg (26 lb) manganese, 12kg (26 lb) nickel and 35kg (77 lb) graphite. Not all retrieved materials may reach battery-grade quality when recycled but the gained resources can be used for less demanding purposes. Lithium is also used as a lubricant.\nProgress is being made and Duesenfeld GmbH demonstrates an innovative method that uses 70% less energy to recycle lithium-ion batteries that with traditional smelting furnaces. Figure 2 illustrates the recycling plant for electric vehicle batteries in Germany.\nThe recycling process of Li-ion batteries normally begins with deactivation involving a full discharge to remove the stored energy and prevent a surprise thermal event. The electrolyte can also be frozen to prevent electrochemical reactions during the crushing process. Duesenfeld patented a process that evaporates and recovers the organic solvents of the electrolyte in a vacuum by condensation. This process is said to not produce toxic exhaust gases. In Figure 3, technicians disassemble EV batteries for recycling.\nThe following steps are divided into mechanical, pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical treatments. Mechanical involves crushing the battery cells; pyrometallurgical extracts the metals by thermal treatment; and hydrometallurgy involves aqueous processes.\nOnce disassembled, sorting separates copper foil, aluminum foil, separator and the coating materials. Nickel, cobalt and copper can be recycled from the cast, but lithium and aluminum remain in the slag. A hydrometallurgical process is necessary to recover lithium. This includes leaching, extraction, crystallization, and precipitation from a liquid solution. Hydrometallurgical treatment is used to recover pure metals, e.g. lithium, gleaned from separated coating materials after mechanical processes or from slag in pyrometallurgical processes.\nUmicore in Belgium uses a furnace to melt the batteries directly to recover 95% of cobalt, nickel and copper. After the furnace, Umicore uses a special gas washing process to clean the toxic incineration products from the fluorine containing exhaust gases.\nTo reduce the dangers of fire incidents during the recycling process, smaller recyclers incinerate lithium-ion batteries externally in special waste treatment facilities before doing mechanical separation.\nDuesenfeld in Germany discharges the batteries, crushes them in inert atmosphere, evaporates and re-condenses the organic solvents of the electrolyte and separates the electrode coating material from the rest. The metals are then leached from the former active materials. The graphite is filtered and regained, after which lithium-carbonate, nickel-sulfate, cobalt-sulfate and manganese-sulfate are produced. This recycling process yields more metals than with the Umicore thermal method. The CO2 footprint is also reduced while saving energy and lowering the formation of hazardous gases.\nAlkaline: After lowering the mercury content in alkaline batteries in 1996, many territories now allow disposing these batteries as regular domestic trash; however, California considers all batteries hazardous waste. In Europe, lead acid, NiCd, mercury containing batteries, unsorted collections of multiple battery types, and battery electrolytes are considered hazardous waste. All others can pass as non-hazardous. Most stores selling batteries are also required to take back spent batteries. Alkaline batteries contain the reusable materials of zinc and manganese but the retrieval process is a liability. Efforts are made to increase the recycling of alkaline cells from the low 4 percent in 2015 to 40 percent in 2025.\nIn North America, Retriev Technologies, formerly Toxco, and the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC) collect spent batteries and recycle them. While Retriev has its own recycling facilities, RBRC is in charge of collecting batteries and sending them to recycling organizations. Retriev in Trail, British Columbia, claims to be the only company in the world that recycles large lithium batteries. They receive spent batteries from oil drilling in Nigeria, Indonesia and other places. They also recycle retired lithium batteries from the Minuteman missile silos and tons of Li-ion from war efforts. Other divisions at Retriev recycle nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal-hydride, lead, mercury, alkaline and more.\nEurope and Asia are also active in recycling spent batteries. Among other recycling companies, Sony and Sumitomo Metal in Japan and Umicore in Belgium have developed technology to retrieve cobalt and other precious metals from spent lithium ion batteries. (See BU-705a: Battery Recycling as a Business)\nUmicore uses an ultra-high temperature (UHT) processes to recycle Li-ion and NiMH batteries. Spent packs are dismantled and melted in an UHT furnace. The derbies are separated into metal alloy containing copper, cobalt and nickel, and slag, a stony waste containing rare earth metals. Slag can be further processed to recover lithium, but producing battery-grade lithium is not yet economical and the slag is used for construction. Methods are being developed to extract lithium for reprocessing into lithium carbonate for Li-ion production. With an anticipated 10-fold growth in the use of Li-ion batteries between 2020 and 2030, the reuse of lithium could become economical so the metals end up in battery production again much like lead for lead acid batteries.\nRecycling starts by sorting batteries into chemistries. Collection centers place lead acid, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal-hydride and lithium ion into designated drums, sacks or boxes. Battery recyclers claim that recycling can be made profitable if a steady stream of batteries, sorted by chemistry, is made available.\nThe recycling process begins by removing the combustible material, such as plastics and insulation, with a gas-fired thermal oxidizer. Polluting particles created by the burning process are eliminated by the plant’s scrubber before release into the atmosphere. This leaves the clean and naked cells with metal content.\nThe cells are then chopped into small pieces and heated until the metal liquefies. Non-metallic substances are burned off, leaving a black slag on top that a slag arm removes. The alloys settle according to weight and are skimmed off like cream from raw milk while still in liquid form.\nCadmium is relatively light and vaporizes at high temperatures. In a process that appears like a pan of water boiling over, a fan blows the cadmium vapor into a large tube that is cooled with water mist. The vapors condense to produce cadmium that is 99.95 percent pure.\nSome recyclers do not separate the metals on site but pour the liquid metals directly into what the industry refers to as “pigs” (65 pounds, 24kg) or “hogs” (2,000 pounds, 746kg). Other battery recyclers use nuggets (7 pound, 3.17kg). The pigs, hogs and nuggets are shipped to metal recovery plants where they are used to produce nickel, chromium and iron for stainless steel and other high-end products.\nTo reduce the possibility of a reactive event during crushing, some recyclers use a liquid solution or freeze lithium-based batteries with liquid nitrogen; however, mixing Li-ion starter batteries with the common lead acid type still remains a problem as a charged Li-ion is far more explosive than lead acid.\nBattery recycling is energy intensive. Reports reveal that it takes 6 to 10 times more energy to reclaim metals from some recycled batteries than from mining. The exception is the lead acid battery, from which lead can be extracted easily and reused without elaborate processes. To some extent, nickel from NiMH can also be recovered economically if available in large quantities.\nNew recycling methods are being developed that retrieve the metals by electrolysis, also knowns as chemical recycling. The process is said to be more cost effective and produces higher yields with less pollutants than traditional smelting. One such alternative to recycle lead acid batteries has been developed by Aqua Metals. This technology has the potential of revolutionizing traditional melting methods. An electrochemical process separates the lead by breaking down metals into nanoscopic sizes particles that are dispersed in water to create a hydro-collodial metal. The process is called AquaRefining. Technical issues are delaying full implementation at this time.\nEach country sets its own rules and adds tariffs to the purchase price of a new battery to make recycling feasible. In North America, some recycling plants invoice by weight and the rates vary according to chemistry. While NiMH yields a fairly good return with nickel, the spent NiCd battery is less in demand because of soft cadmium prices. Due to poor metal retrieval value, Li-ion commands a higher recycling fee than most other battery types.\nRecycling Li-ion batteries is not yet profitable must be government subsidized. There is an incentive to recover costly cobalt. No recycling technology exists today that is capable of producing pure enough lithium for a second use in batteries. Lithium for batteries is mined; second hand lithium is used for lubricants, glass, ceramics and other applications.\nThe flat cost to recycle a ton of batteries is $1,000 to $2,000; Europe hopes to achieve a cost per ton of $300. Ideally, this would include transportation, but moving and handling the goods is expected to double the overall cost. To simplify transportation, Europe is setting up several smaller processing plants in strategic geographic locations. This, in part, is due to the Basel Convention that prohibits the export of complete but spent lead acid batteries. As the volume of discarded batteries increases, new technologies are being tried to make recycling profitable without the support of agencies and governments.\n[1] Source: Johnston Controls[2] Schroll, Wolfram.Duesenfeld. n.d. https://www.duesenfeld.com\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Assuring Safety of Lithium-ion in the Workforce",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/assuring-safety-of-lithium-ion-in-the-workforce",
        "content": "Lithium-ion batteries do occasionally overheat and catch fire, and this is a large concern in industry. Regulatory approvals are tough, but once accepted and rubberstamped; officials wash their hands and put the responsibility for care in the hands of the user. Approval procedures are mainly directed towards birth-to-graduation; few regularity requirements exist after the battery has been approved as part of workforce to retirement. While this works well for the more benign lead- and nickel-based batteries; lithium-ion has definite red lines that must be respected.\nThis article touches on the approval process and proposes methods to monitor Li-ion batteries in the field to detect anomalies that may develop under environmental stresses. All batteries age but changes in characteristics are especially troublesome with Li-ion. One way to observe anomalies is including diagnostic features in chargers and battery-operated devices, a method that will improve safety without added logistics. The article also addresses the choice of Li-ion to meet load profile and environmental exposures. Such considerations may one day play a role in the approval process to assure batteries operate within a safe bandwidth.\nManufacturers are ultimately responsible for the safety of a battery. UN/DOT 38.3 requires that Li-ion cells be tested for air worthiness to endure altitude simulation, thermal, vibration, shock short circuit, impact, overcharge and forced discharge checks. These tests are done on new or near new Li-ion cells, but not packs that may be past their prime. The safety verifications in the workforce seem to be overlooked; all efforts go to before approval; the after approval moves beyond reach.\nThe before approval resembles the life of students receiving academic knowledge to prepare for a career with examination to test the understanding before graduation; the after approval represents the workforce where users are on their own, often with little guidance. Rules become vague. Having to depend on a power source that also diminishes capacity with each cycle prompts the user to ask: “How often should I test the battery? How much spare capacity is enough? At what capacity should I replace the battery?”\nIn spite of rigorous testing, Li-ion fires are being reported, and these infractions are of serious concern to healthcare, defense and communications. With more Li-ion also being deployed for large scale uses, the question is asked, “should more be done to assure continued safety once the battery is past its prime?” Instead of placing all efforts in the before approval phase, a maintenance-based system would monitor the battery in the field and advise the user of emerging defects that could compromise safety. The Li-ion battery is unique in that it can hide a defect while continuing to deliver full performance. A faulty building or a corroded bridge reacts differently in that structures display visible stress marks that enable safety measures; Li-ion does not give such prior warning.\nThe ongoing safety of Li-ion batteries can be summarized into three categories:\nProduct certification gives the green light to release a Li-ion cell into the market; it also enables air shipment. However, maintenance issues appear only once a product has been in use for a while. Batteries should receive a similar treatment as a critical part in an aircraft or machine in which wear and tear falls under guidelines. This is especially important when batteries are exposed to stressful conditions that include heat, ultra-rapid charging, charging below freezing, harsh loading and vibration.\nTo stay within the red line, the choice of Li-ion is important in the design process. The Energy Cell provides high specific energy but delivers moderate loading currents and requires long charge times. The Power Cell is reserved for high load current that also enables faster charging but it has reduced capacity. The need to tailor a battery to specific applications was less common with nickel-cadmium (NiCd) systems. One type served most uses.\nA compromised Li-ion in fail-mode is more critical than lead- and nickel-based systems. Separator damage in Li-ion must be taken seriously as most fires are caused by a separator failure that can lead to an electrical short. NiCds are more forgiving in this respect. The separator can get so marred by high cycle count and crystalline formation (memory) that the battery self-discharges in 8 hours.\nHigh self-discharge in Li-ion can also occur when dendrites form as a result of ultra-fast charging, harsh loading or sub-freezing charging. Storing a Li-ion cell in low state-of-charge is also known to grow dendrites. One of the biggest concerns of Li-ion manufacturers, however, is foreign particles converging on one spot. Improvements have been made but they report that complex assembly techniques make the elimination of all metallic dust a challenge. Cells with ultra-thin separators of only 20µm or less (20-thousandth of an mm) are more susceptible to impurities than the older designs.\nA compromised separator in a Li-ion cell may only causes a slight elevation of self-discharge. For most cells, this condition remains stable, but in rare cases, the fault line can develop into a sizable current flowing between the electrodes in the cell. The spot may heat up and weaken the separator further until it develops into an electrical short. An analogy is a small water leak in a faulty hydro dam that can turn into a torrent and takes the structure down. The temperature of a shorted Li-ion can quickly reach 500°C (932°F), at which point the cell catches fire or explodes. A thermal runaway is known as “venting with flame.” Once in progress, the event cannot be stopped and needs to burn out.\nBattery manufacturers share cleanliness standards with the semiconductor industry. Chip makers have spent millions of dollars to reduce particles that can lead to the loss of wafers. The world’s best cleanrooms are ISO 4 (Class 10), meaning no more than 10,000 particles larger than 0.1 micrometer (µm) are present. Even at this low level, particles still affect semiconductor wafers. Batteries are often made in less stringently controlled cleanrooms and cleanliness may need to improve to be equal or better than that of semiconductor manufacturing.\nA tier-1 supplier acknowledges that lithium-ion batteries have a fire risk. Their suggested precaution includes current limiting in a parallel configuration to render a shorted cell harmless, lowering charge voltages when the battery capacity fades, providing traceable lot numbers down to cell and pack level, building a pack that inhibits propagation from cell to cell in case of fire, and enabling exhaust gases to escape while preventing fire from leaking outside the pack.\nThe tier-1 supplier also reveals that cycling increases the pressure to the electrodes. The anode thickens with use, which further intensifies pressure on the separator. With foreign materials that cannot be fully avoided, the tier-1 supplier confirms that normal use of Li-ion can lead to an electrical short in isolated cases. Because of customer requests for higher capacities and maintaining the required safety level at all time, the tier-1 supplier recommends reducing the charge voltage to adjust for capacity fade as follows:\nThe tier-1 supplier also suggests reducing the charge voltage by 0.1V in healthcare for critical and disabled patients. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the intrinsic changes of a Li-ion cell as a function of aging that can lead to premature failure.\nIncreased pressure raises the risk of internal short if foreign materials are present. A cylindrical cell maintains correct size. Expansion allowance must be made for prismatic and pouch cells.\nIncreased pressure reduces the thickness of the separator. Aging also grows the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the anode and electrolyte oxidation (EO) on the cathode. Courtesy of Panasonic/CadexThe failure rate of Li-ion has improved and is now better than one-in-10 million. Credit goes to diligent battery manufacturers that take safety seriously. No other battery failure draws more media attention than a Li-ion fire. All energy storage devices carry risk and the public was alarmed in the 1800s when steam engines exploded and people got hurt. Carrying highly flammable gasoline in cars was a hot topic in the early 1900s. Thomas Edison had good reasons to promote the electric car in the early 1900s as being a better option. He promoted nickel-iron in favor of lead acid, not lithium-ion.\nThere are two types of Li-ion failures. One involves a design or manufacturing flaw in which the failure repeats itself at a predictable rate and often involves a recall; the Samsung Galaxy 7 smartphones in 2016 and the Sony laptop batteries in 2006 are examples. The most difficult failures are random events. These may be caused by repeated charging at sub-freezing temperature, harsh loading or excessive vibration. It can also be a fluke similar to being hit by a meteor.\nCadex is performing lab tests to measure the self-discharge rates between good Li-ion cells and those that have been stressed. The objective is to develop a failure detection method, assuming that a thermal event is proceeded by high self-discharge. To our knowledge, no formal research has been carried out on this topic. If elevated self-discharge can be identified on a compromised Li-ion cell, algorithms can be developed that issue a CAUTION message if the battery needs replacement and a DANGER if the pack reaches the threat of a thermal event.\nLi-ion is one of the best battery systems but it is unforgiving in fail-mode. Maintenance-based safety features may be needed for some systems as part of after approval to enable safe operation of Li-ion from workforce-to-retirement under all conditions. Traditional certification was sufficient to approve lead- and nickel-based batteries because these systems reach end-of-life by loss of performance. Although fires are also reported with non-lithium-based batteries, they are less frequent per watt-hour and are more manageable.\nMany Li-ion batteries keep performing even when a fault develops. An analogy is an aging steam engine that still delivers full power with a boiler that no longer meets safety requirements. Concerns also apply to aging Li-ion installations in Energy Storage Systems and boats. The aging syndrome may not be fully understood yet as most these systems are new. We ask the question: “will capacity or safety determine the end-of-life?’\nChargers with diagnostic features that advise the user of a pending battery defect are possible. These chargers will perform quality control by predicting when a battery needs replacing based on capacity estimations and identifying anomalies.\nSoftware based on advanced machine learning (AML) is in development that can be added to a charger or portable device to provide monitoring functions at an economical price. These systems go beyond voltage, current and coulomb-counting, but examine the health of the chemical battery. AML is also used in voice and image recognition, as well as the self-driving car. Besides making the battery safer, AML estimates battery capacity during charge to make performance data transparent to the user. It’s connecting dots by utilizing existing technologies that will make the battery a safer, more reliable and environmentally friendly product.\nIsidor Buchmann is the founder and CEO of Cadex Electronics Inc.

        "title": "BU-801a: How to Rate Battery Runtime",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-801a-how-to-rate-battery-runtime",
        "content": "The consumer market follows set standards in specifying battery runtime, but these are loose and some associations develop their own rules by using the lightest load patterns possible to achieve good numbers. This results in specifications that carry little resemblance to reality. Under pressure from consumer associations, manufacturers have finally agreed to standardize testing procedures on key consumer products.\nThe Camera and Imaging Products Association (CIPA) set up in Japan in 2002 succeeded in developing a standardized battery-life test for digital cameras. Under the test scheme, the camera takes a photo every 30 seconds, half of them with flash and the other without. The test zooms the lens in and out all the way before a shot is taken and leaves the screen on. After every 10 shots, the camera is turned off for a while and the cycle is repeated. CIPA ratings replicate a realistic way a consumer would use a camera and most new cameras adopt the CIPA protocol to rate the runtime.\nThe runtime on laptops is more complex to estimate than a digital camera as programs, type of activity, wireless features and screen brightness affect the energy consumption. To take these conditions into account, the computer industry developed a standard called MobileMark 2014, an application-based benchmark that reflects usage patterns for business users. MobileMark is built on the 20-year history of BAPCo (Business Applications Performance Corporation) in building benchmarks to evaluate platform technologies.\nNot everyone agrees with the established norm and opponents say that the convention trims the applications down and ignores real-world practices. The setting of brightness is one example. The display is one of the most power-hungry components of a modern laptop or tablet, and at full brightness the screen delivers 250 to 300 nits. (A nit is a unit of brightness equal to one Candela per square meter. Candela is a unit of luminous intensity.) MobileMark is said to use a setting that is less than half of this. Nor does MobileMark include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth; it leaves these peripherals up to the manufacturers to investigate.\nMobile phone manufacturers face similar challenges when estimating runtimes. Standby and talk time are field-strength dependent and the closer you are to a repeater tower, the lower the transmit power will get and the longer the battery will last. CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) takes slightly more power than GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications); however, the more critical power guzzlers are touch screen displays, video presentations, web surfing, as well as the use of GPS, camera, voice dialing and Bluetooth. Web-browsing and video-watching typically cut the runtime in half compared to mere talking on the phone.\nAlthough battery capacity has increased and the circuits have become more efficient, these improvements do not compensate for the added features of a smartphone that also sees longer and more frequent usages between charges than mere talking. A new energy crisis is emerging.\nFigure 1 illustrates battery improvement against the lack of energy with the early analog cell phones during the 1990s, the sudden excess energy with the digital phones, and the lack of energy in modern smartphones and tablets. Improvements in battery capacity cannot keep pace with added consumption.\nThe capacity of Li-ion has doubled in 12 years and the circuits draw less power; however, these improvements do not compensate for the power demand of the new features.\nSmartphones and tablets operate on a single Li-ion cell, and this has a decisive advantage over a laptop battery. Cell-matching is not required as with the laptop packs running at 14.40V in a typical 4S2P configuration. This simplifies cell manufacturing and increases the yields by opening the flood-gates for broader performance acceptance.\nMost users would not notice if a battery came with the specified 100 percent capacity or only 90 percent. Manufacturers know that consumer batteries vary in capacity and that the user will not test them, especially those that are non-replaceable. No rules exist as to what constitutes an acceptable battery other than meeting the obligatory 80 percent within the warranty period.\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-307: How does Electrolyte Work?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-307-how-does-electrolyte-work",
        "content": "Electrolyte serves as catalyst to make a battery conductive by promoting the movement of ions from the cathode to the anode on charge and in reverse on discharge. Ions are electrically charged atoms that have lost or gained electrons. The electrolyte of a battery consists of soluble salts, acids or other bases in liquid, gelled and dry formats. Electrolyte also comes in a polymer, as used in the solid-state battery, solid ceramic and molten salts, as in the sodium-sulfur battery.\nLead acid uses sulfuric acid. When charging, the acid becomes denser as lead oxide (PbO2) forms on the positive plate, and then turns to almost water when fully discharged. The specific gravity of the sulfuric acid is measured with a hydrometer. (See also BU-903: How to Measure State-of-charge). Lead acid batteries come in flooded and sealed formats also known as valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) or maintenance-free.\nSulfuric acid is colorless with a slight yellow-green tint, soluble in water and is highly corrosive. Discoloration to a brownish tint may be caused by rusting from anodic corrosion or from water entering in the battery pack.\nLead acid batteries come with different specific gravities (SG). Deep-cycle batteries use a dense electrolyte with an SG of up to 1.330 to achieve high specific energy, starter batteries contain an average SG of about 1.265 and stationary batteries come with a low SG of roughly 1.225 to moderate corrosion and promote longevity. (See BU-903: How to Measure State-of-charge).\nSulfuric acid serves a wide range of applications and is also found in drain cleaners and various cleaning agents. It further serves in mineral processing mineral processing, fertilizer manufacturing, oil refining, wastewater processing and chemical synthesis.\nThe electrolyte in NiCd is an alkaline electrolyte (potassium hydroxide). Most NiCd batteries are cylindrical in which several layers of positive and negative materials are wound into a jelly-roll. The flooded version of NiCd is used as the ship-battery in commercial aircrafts and in UPS systems operating in hot and cold climates requiring frequent cycling. NiCd is more expensive than lead acid but lasts longer.\nNiMH uses the same or similar electrolyte as NiCd, which is usually potassium hydroxide. The NiMH electrodes are unique and consist of nickel, cobalt, manganese, aluminum and rare earth metals, which are also used in Li-ion. NiMH is available in sealed versions only.\nPotassium hydroxide is an inorganic compound with the formula KOH, commonly called caustic potash. The electrolyte is colorless and has many industrial applications, such as the ingredient in most soft and liquid soaps. KOH is harmful if indigested.\nLi-ion uses liquid, gel or dry polymer electrolyte. The liquid version is a flammable organic rather than aqueous type, a solution of lithium salts with organic solvents similar to ethylene carbonate. Mixing the solutions with diverse carbonates provides higher conductivity and expands the temperature range. Other salts may be added to reduce gassing and improve high temperature cycling.\nLi-ion with gelled electrolytes receives many additives to increase conductivity, so does the lithium-polymer battery. The true dry polymer only becomes conductive at elevated temperatures, and this battery is no longer in commercial use. Additives are also administered to achieve longevity and unique characteristics. The recipe is classified and each manufacturer has its own secret sauce. (See also BU-808b: What causes Li-ion to die?)\nThe electrolyte should be stable, but this is not the case with Li-ion. A passivation film forms on the anode that is called solid electrolyte interface (SEI). This layer separates the anode from the cathode but allows ions to pass through much like a separator. In essence, the SEI layer must form to enable the battery to work. The film stabilizes the system and gives the Li-ion a long life but this causes a capacity reduction. Electrolyte oxidation also occurs on the cathode that permanently lowers the capacity. (See also BU-701: How to Prime Batteries)\nTo prevent the films from becoming too restrictive, additives are mixed with the electrolyte that is consumed during the formation of the SEI layer. It is difficult, if impossible, to trace their presence when doing a forensic evaluation. This keeps proprietary additives a trade secret, both their composition and the amount used.\nA well-known additive is vinylene carbonate (VC). This chemical improves the cycle life of Li-ion, especially at higher temperatures, and keeps the internal resistance low with use and age. VC also maintains a stable SEI film on the anode with no adverse side effects of the electrolyte oxidation on the cathode (Aurbach et al). It is said that academic and research communities are lagging behind cell manufacturers in knowledge and choice of additives, hence the great secret. (See also “Additives and the Effects on Coulombinc Efficiency” as part of BU-808b: What causes Li-ion to die?\nFor most commercial Li-ion, the SEI layer will break down at a cell temperature of 75–90°C (167–194°F). The type of cell and state-of-charge (SoC) affects the breakdown at elevated temperature. A self-heating behavior may occur that can lead to a thermal runaway if not properly cooled. Lab tests done on 18650 cells have shown that such a thermal event can take two days to develop.\nThe flammability of the Li-ion electrolyte is a further concern and experiments are done to produce non-flammable or reduced flammable electrolytes by additives or developing non-organic ionic liquids. Research is also conducted to operate Li-ion at low temperatures. At time of writing, none of these electrolytes are in wide commercial use.\nDrying up or slowly turning the liquid electrolyte into a solid form is one more aging event that lowers the performance of Li-ion. “When the liquid is gone, the batteries are dead,” says Jeff Dahn, specialist in Li-ion batteries and Professor of Physics. Liquidity of the electrolyte is one more state-of-health indicator that relates to all battery chemistries.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-804b: Sulfation and How to Prevent it",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-804b-sulfation-and-how-to-prevent-it",
        "content": "Sulfation occurs when a lead acid battery is deprived of a full charge. This is common with starter batteries in cars driven in the city with load-hungry accessories. A motor in idle or at low speed cannot charge the battery sufficiently.\nElectric wheelchairs have a similar problem in that the users might not charge the battery long enough. An 8-hour charge during the night when the chair is not being used is not enough. Lead acid must periodically be charged 14–16 hours to attain full saturation. This may be the reason why wheelchair batteries last only 2 years, whereas golf cars with the identical battery deliver twice the service life. Long leisure time allows golf car batteries to get a full charge overnight (See BU-403: Charging Lead Acid).\nSolar cells and wind turbines do not always provide sufficient charge for lead acid banks, which can lead to sulfation. This happens in remote parts of the world where villagers draw generous amounts of electricity with insufficient renewable resources to charge the batteries. The result is a short battery life. Only a periodic fully saturated charge can solve the problem. But without an electrical grid at their disposal, this is almost impossible.\nAn alternative solution is using lithium-ion, a battery that prefers a partial charge to a full charge. However, Li-ion is more than double the cost of lead acid. Although more expensive, the cycle count is said to be cheaper than that of lead acid because of the extended service life.\nWhat is sulfation? During use, small sulfate crystals form, but these are normal and are not harmful. During prolonged charge deprivation, however, the amorphous lead sulfate converts to a stable crystalline and deposits on the negative plates. This leads to the development of large crystals that reduce the battery’s active material, which is responsible for the performance.\nThere are two types of sulfation: reversible (or soft sulfation), and permanent (or hard sulfation). If a battery is serviced early, reversible sulfation can often be corrected by applying an overcharge to an already fully charged battery in the form of a regulated current of about 200mA. The battery terminal voltage is allowed to rise to between 2.50 and 2.66V/cell (15 and 16V on a 12V mono block) for about 24 hours. Increasing the battery temperature to 50–60°C (122–140°F) during the corrective service further helps in dissolving the crystals.\nPermanent sulfation sets in when the battery has been in a low state-of-charge for weeks or months. At this stage, no form of restoration seems possible; however, the recovery yield is not fully understood. To everyone’s amazement, new lead acid batteries can often be fully restored after dwelling in a low-voltage condition for many weeks. Other factors may play a role.\nA subtle indication whether lead acid can be recovered or not is visible on the voltage discharge curve. If a fully charged battery retains a stable voltage profile on discharge, chances of reactivation are better than if the voltage drops rapidly with load.\nSeveral companies offer anti-sulfation devices that apply pulses to the battery terminals to prevent and reverse sulfation. Such technologies will lower the sulfation on a healthy battery, but they cannot effectively reverse the condition once present. It’s a “one size fits all” approach and the method is unscientific.\nApplying random pulses or blindly inducing an overcharge can harm the battery by promoting grid corrosion. There are no simple methods to measure sulfation, nor are commercial chargers available that apply a calculated overcharge to dissolve the crystals. As with medicine, the most effective remedy is to apply a corrective service for the time needed and not longer.\nWhile anti-sulfation devices can reverse the condition, some battery manufacturers do not recommend the treatment as it tends to create soft shorts that may increase self-discharge. Furthermore, the pulses contain ripple voltage that causes some heating of the battery. Battery manufacturers specify the allowable ripple when charging lead acid batteries.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "The charge algorithm for NiMH is similar to NiCd with the exception that NiMH is more complex. Negative Delta V to detect full charge is faint, especially when charging at less than 0.5C. A mismatched or hot pack reduces the symptoms further.\nNDV in a NiMH charger should respond to a voltage drop of 5mV per cell or less. This requires electronic filtering to compensate for noise and voltage fluctuations induced by the battery and the charger. Well-designed NiMH chargers include NDV, voltage plateau, delta temperature (dT/dt), temperature threshold and time-out timers into the full-charge detection algorithm. These “or-gates” utilize whatever comes first. Many chargers include a 30-minute topping charge of 0.1C to boost the capacity by a few percentage points.\nSome advanced chargers apply an initial fast charge of 1C. When reaching a certain voltage threshold, a rest of a few minutes is added, allowing the battery to cool down. The charge continues at a lower current and then applies further current reductions as the charge progresses. This scheme continues until the battery is fully charged. Known as the “step-differential charge,” this method works well for all nickel-based batteries.\nChargers utilizing the step-differential or other aggressive charge methods achieve a capacity gain of about 6 percent over a more basic charger. Although a higher capacity is desirable, filling the battery to the brim adds stress and shortens the overall battery life. Rather than achieving the expected 350–400 service cycles, the aggressive charger might exhaust the pack after 300 cycles.\nNiMH dislikes overcharge, and the trickle charge is set to around 0.05C. NiCd is better at absorbing overcharge and the original NiCd chargers had a trickle charge of 0.1C. The differences in trickle charge current and the need for more sensitive full-charge detection render the original NiCd charger unsuitable for NiMH batteries. A NiMH in a NiCd charger would overheat, but a NiCd in a NiMH charger functions well. Modern chargers accommodate both battery systems.\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to slow charge a NiMH battery. At a C rate of 0.1C to 0.3C, the voltage and temperature profiles do not exhibit defined characteristics to trigger full-charge detection, and the charger must depend on a timer. Harmful overcharge can occur when charging partially or fully charged batteries, even if the battery remains cold.\nThe same scenario occurs if the battery has lost capacity and can only hold half the charge. In essence, this battery has shrunk to half the size while the fixed timer is programmed to apply a 100 percent charge without regard for battery condition.\nMany battery users complain about shorter than expected service life and the fault might lie in the charger. Low-priced consumer chargers are prone to incorrect charging. If you want to improve battery performance with a low-cost charger, estimate the battery state-of-charge and set the charge time accordingly. Remove the batteries when presumed full.\nIf your charger charges at a high charge rate, do a temperature check. Lukewarm indicates that the batteries may be full. It is better to remove the batteries early and recharge before each use than to leave them in the charger for eventual use.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

I've been very pleased.\nAndrew:\nMaybe it's too late for an answer, but if money is tight I suggest charging the batteries and then discharging them to 1.1 volts per cell. Do this several times. If you're lucky, you'll find that they still have enough capacity left. \nIf money isn't tight or they MUST be reliable, I think Ross's suggestion of nicads is a good one. Just keep in mind that they are far more toxic than nimh and you should recycle them rather than throwing them away. Also, if you're only using 150mAh per day, you can probably use smaller batteries. Finally, I wouldn't be surprised if more sophisticated charging software was available for the Arduino, extending the battery's life.\nI have a 1.4V -240mAh charger that came with my NiCad glow-plug igniter, Can I use it to charge a 1.2V 3400mAh Ni-MH replacement battery?\nNot all of the batteries will be bad. Contacts may be oxidized. Consider a project where you replace one battery set after cleaning the electrodes. If possible, replace damaged wiring with slightly larger gauge- it will survive longer. Take the old battery set home and test. Some cells may still be ok - reuse them.\nMissing graphics.\nAndrew: I think you might consider a Ni-Cad instead, due to their relative tolerance to trickle charging and overcharging.  This may be a case where the earlier technology may be better suited. If the capacity is sufficient.\nI am trickle charging  2Ah 4.8v  NiMH in Africa to monitor hand pumped water Well output. They are charged by the sun at about 100mA for about 8 hrs/day. The equipment consumes 150mAh / day. There is sun for about 75% of the month. The solar cells are a nominal 6v 600mW. An Arduino stops charging the 4.8v pack at about 5.8v.I use RS Pro AA cells. They have been in use for two years but have been left in the office for the past year! They are now at 180mV each cell! Will they survive if placed in the sun again or is it time to 'retire' them?\nSorry about this but the BatteryUni states never to trickle charge them for very long, certainly not two years but I can't see an alternative?

        "title": "BU-904: How to Measure Capacity",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-904-how-to-measure-capacity",
        "content": "Capacity is the leading health indicator of a battery, but estimating it on the fly is complex. The traditional charge/discharge/charge cycle is still the most dependable method to measure battery capacity. While portable batteries can be cycled relatively quickly, a full cycle on large lead acid batteries is not practical for capacity measurement.\nSAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) specifies the capacity of a starter battery by Reserve Capacity (RC). RC reflects the runtime in minutes at a steady discharge of 25A. DIN (Deutsches Institut für Normung) and IEC (International Electrochemical Commission) mark the battery in Ah at a typical discharge of 0.2C-rate (5h ate) for starter batteries. A 60Ah battery would discharge at 12A. No accurate RC to Ah conversion exists but the most common formula is RC divided by 2 plus 16. A short method is dividing RC by 1.9.\nOne would assume that capacity measurement by discharge is the most accurate method, but this is not always the case, especially with lead acid batteries. Even when using highly accurate equipment in a temperature controlled environment and following established charge and discharge standards, variations between identical tests occur. This is not fully understood except to realize that batteries are electrochemical devices that have human-like qualities. Our IQ level also varies depending on the time of day and other conditions. Lithium- and nickel-based chemistries provide more consistent discharge results than lead acid.\nCadex labs checked 91 starter batteries with diverse performance levels, and the results have been plotted in Figure 1. The horizontal x-axis presents the batteries from weak to strong, and the vertical y-axis reflects the capacity. The tests followed SAE J537 standards by applying a full charge and a 24-hour rest, followed by a regulated 25A discharge to 10.50V (1.75V/cell). The results in diamonds represent Test 1. The test was repeated under identical conditions, and the capacities shown in squares characterize Test 2. Only done within days of each other, Test 1 and 2 differ much as +/-15 percent average in capacity. Other laboratories observe similar discrepancies.\nWhen evaluating battery test results, the question is asked: “Against what standard are the readings compared?” If done with the classic charge/discharge cycle that has large inaccuracies, then modern test technologies have no benchmark and scientists may ask: “Which method is more accurate, the discharge/charge method or other evolving technologies?” This is a valid question as non-intrusive technologies are emerging that only take seconds to test a battery.\nSpectro™ (by Cadex) uses multi-model electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) that checks battery health in seconds with a scanning process. The non-invasive technology combines EIS with complex modeling to estimate capacity, CCA and SoC with the help of matrices, also known as look-up tables. Here is how it works:\nA sinusoidal signal of multiple frequencies is injected into the battery at a few millivolts. After digital filtering, the extracted signal forms a Nyquist plot onto which various electro-chemical models are superimposed. Spectro™ selects the best matching models; non-fitting replicas are rejected. Data fusion then correlates the values of the key parameters to derive at capacity and CCA estimations. Figure 2 illustrates the patented process in a simplified way.\nA sinusoidal signal produces a Nyquist plot; data fusion correlates the values of the key parameters to estimate capacity and CCA.\nThe Nyquist plot was invented by Harry Nyquist (1889–1976) while at Bell Laboratories. It presents the frequency response of a linear system displaying both amplitude and phase angle on a single plot using frequency as parameter. The horizontal x-axis of a Nyquist plot reveals the real ohm impedance while the vertical y-axis represents the imaginary impedance(See BU-907: Testing Lithium-based Batteries)\nStarter batteries have two distinct values, CCA and capacity. These two readings are different; one cannot predict the other and correlation between the two is almost non-existent, except perhaps towards the end of battery life(See BU-806, Tracking Battery Capacity and Resistance as part of Aging)\nMost rapid-testers look at the internal resistance and do a CCA approximation. Reading battery resistance is relatively simple, but this alone cannot predict capacity, nor can it tell when to replace a battery as the end-of-life characteristic is primarily capacity related. Most starter batteries crank the engine with very little capacity; a sudden failure might occur when the capacity drops below 30 percent.\nSome battery testers, including Spectro™, display “Resistance High” when the ohmic reading is elevated, a failure that commonly relates to heat damage. A working starter battery reflects a single-digit mOhm value that is represented by R1 in the Randles model on the right(See BU-902: How to Measure Internal Resistance) Batteries developing high resistance move into double-digit readings, and these can be caused by these conditions:\nR1 represents the electrolyte resistance, which is affected by items 1 and 2 above. Items 3 to 6 relate R1 characterizes the electrolyte resistance created by low electrolyte and/or acid stratification as reflected in items 1 and 2 of the above listed conditions. Items 3 to 6 relate to sulfation, corrosion and contact resistance from the battery posts to the electrodes as well as the electrodes to the electrolyte.\nThe R2/C parallel circuit represents charge transfer resistance and speed. It signifies the required energy needed to overcome the potential barrier at the electrode-electrolyte interface that activates the ion inside the electrolyte, which results in moving electrons from the electrode to the terminals. On a poor battery, the barrier resistance is higher than in a good battery with high capacity. The R2/C branch holds the secret to capacity estimation and differ from the more mechanical conditions captured in R1.\nThe ability to separate individual components in the Randles model, as Spectro™ does, enables improved battery assessment that reduces battery replacement, especially during the warranty period. “Resistance High” distinguishes a battery with low charge from one that has a genuine defect. The test can be done with a partial charge.\n“How accurate are the readings?” car mechanics ask. This depends on the battery. A fault can only be diagnosed with confidence if clear symptoms are present. A new battery or one that has been in storage can become an outlier on capacity estimation. Best results are achieved with a “working” battery that is pulled from service. Accuracy is also based on the quality of the matrix(See BU-905: Testing Lead Acid Batteries, Matrix).\nAlthough capacity and CCA readings are clearly marked on the battery, these values are not always correct. The CCA of some starter batteries are found to be higher or lower than shown; only the manufacturer would know. Because of high cost, CCA tests are seldom done once the battery is sold. In addition, deep-cycle batteries show low capacity readings when new and this could lead to warranty returns. The values will increase as the battery is being formatted with use(See BU-701: How to Prime Batteries)\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex (2005)[2] J.

        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/wireless-communications",
        "content": "Research has brought about a variety of battery chemistries, each offering distinct advantages but none providing a fully satisfactory solution. With today's variety of battery types, better choices can be made to suit specific user applications. This paper talks about the recommended battery chemistry for cell phones and two-way radios in terms of energy density, durability and price.\nEarly cell phones were powered with nickel-based batteries but most newer phones are now equipped with lithium-ion. This chemistry is lightweight, offers high energy density and lasts long enough to span the typical life of the product. Lithium-ion contains no toxic metals.To obtain thin geometry, some cell phone manufacturers switched to lithium-ion-polymer. This satisfied consumer requests for slim designs. In the meantime, technological advancements also made low profile lithium-ion possible. lithium-ion packs are now available in 3 mm, a profile that suits most designs. lithium-ion has the advantage of lower manufacturing cost, better performance and longer cycle life than the polymer version.Lithium-ion is a low maintenance battery. No periodic discharge is needed and charging can be done at random. A random charge means that the battery does not need to be fully depleted before recharge. In fact, it is better to recharge before the battery gets too low. Full discharges put an unnecessary strain on the battery. A recharge on a partially charged battery does not cause memory because there is none.Charging lithium-ion is simpler and cleaner than nickel-based batteries but the chargers require tighter tolerances. Lithium-ion cannot absorb overcharge and no trickle charge is applied on full charge. This allows lithium-ion to be kept in the chargers until used. Some chargers apply a topping charge every week or so to replenish the capacity lost through self-discharge while the battery sits idle in the charger. Repeated insertion into the charger or cradle does not damage the battery though overcharge. If the battery is full, no charge is applied. The battery voltage determines the need to charge.On the negative side, lithium-ion gradually loses charge acceptance as part of aging, even if not used. lithium-ion batteries should not be stored for long periods but be rotated like perishable food. The buyer should be aware of the manufacturing date when purchasing a replacement battery. Aging affects battery chemistries at different degrees.\nIn the search for low-cost battery replacements, consumers may inadvertently purchase clone cell phone batteries that do not include an approved protection circuit. Lithium-ion packs require a protection circuit to shut off the power source if the charger malfunctions and keep on charging, or if the pack is put under undue stress (electrical short). Overheating and 'venting with flame' can be the result of such strain. (See photos of an exploded cell phone with clone battery on charge.)\nCell phone manufacturers strongly advise customers to replace the battery with an approved brand. Failing to do so may void the warranty. Counterfeit cell phone batteries have become visible since the beginning of 2003 when the world was being flooded with cheap replacement batteries from Asia. Cell phone manufacturers act out of genuine concern for safety rather than using scare tactics to persuade customers to buy their own accessories. They do not object to third party suppliers in offering batteries and chargers as long as the products are well built, safe and functioning. The buyer can often not distinguish between an original and a counterfeit battery because the label may appear bona fide. Caution should also be exercised in purchasing counterfeit chargers. Some units do not terminate the battery correctly and rely on the battery's internal protection circuit to cut off the power when fully charged. Precise full-charge termination and a working protection circuit are needed for the safe use of the lithium-ion battery.\nMost two-way radios use nickel-cadmium. These batteries are durable and forgiving if abused. But nickel-cadmium batteries have only moderate energy density and are environmentally unfriendly. Environmental agencies have been discouraging its use, especially in Europe. The recommended alternative is nickel-metal-hydride, a battery that has higher energy density and contains no toxic metals. nickel-metal-hydride has been tested in two-way radios for a number of years but the results are mixed. Shorter than expected service life is the major drawback. For two-way radios, nickel-metal-hydride has a cycle life, which is half that of standard nickel-cadmium. Nickel-metal-hydride prefers a moderate discharge current of 0.5C or less. A two-way radio, on the other hand, draws a discharge current of about 1.5A when transmitting at 4W of power. High discharge loads and sharp pulse currents shorten battery life.To compare the longevity of nickel-metal-hydride under different load condition, a test was carried out in which batteries of the same type were discharged with a DC and digital load. In both tests, the batteries were discharged to 1.04 volts per cell. The DC load was a steady 500mA; the digital load simulated the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) at 1.65 ampere peak for 12 ms every 100 ms with 270 mA standby. (Note that the GSM pulse for voice is about 550 ms every 4.5 ms).With the DC discharge, nickel-metal-hydride wore out gradually, providing an above average service life. At 700 cycles, the battery still provided 80% capacity. By contrast, the same battery type faded more rapidly with a digital discharge and the 80% capacity threshold was reached after only 300 cycles. This phenomenon indicates that the kinetic characteristics for nickel-metal-hydride deteriorate more rapidly with a digital than analog load. Although the test was simulating a GSM cell phone, Tetra and other digital two-way radios have similar loading. Let's briefly compare the characteristics of nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal-hydride. nickel-cadmium has the advantage of maintaining steady high capacity and low internal resistance through most of its service life. nickel-metal-hydride, on the other hand, starts with good capacity and low internal resistance but the resistance increases after a few hundred cycles, causing the voltage to drop on a load. Even though the energy may still be present, the battery cannot deliver the high current during transmit and the message cuts off. The radio becomes unreliable.Nickel-based batteries are high in maintenance. Periodic discharge cycles are needed to prevent crystalline formation on the cell plates, also known as memory. Nickel-cadmium is more receptive to memory than nickel-metal-hydride because both nickel and cadmium plates are affected by memory. Nickel-cadmium should be exercised once ever 1 to 2 months, whereas nickel-metal-hydride can get by with a deliberate full discharge once every 3 months. Without proper maintenance, the advantage of nickel-cadmium over nickel-metal-hydride in terms of cycle life cannot be realized.Lithium-ion has been tested for two-way radios and the results are positive. Substituting lithium-ion with nickel-based will require chargers specifically suited for this chemistry. While nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal-hydride can often share the same charger, lithium-ion uses a different charge algorithm. There is also a cost premium for lithium-ion. Future two-way radios will undoubtedly be fitted with lithium-ion.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Laptops are known to be tough hosts on their batteries. The host demands a stream of uninterrupted power but offers a poor working environment in return. As a result, the battery cannot provide the promised runtime and the service cuts short, often with little notice. In this paper we address the unhappy marriage between the host and battery, and examine what causes a battery to deteriorate faster than in other portable devices.\nBatteries for laptops have a unique challenge - they must be small and lightweight. In fact, the laptop battery should be invisible to the user and deliver enough power to endure a five-hour flight from Toronto to Vancouver. In reality, a typical laptop battery provides only about 90 minutes of service. Many users complain of much shorter runtimes.Computer manufacturers are hesitant to add a larger battery because of increased size and weight. A recent survey indicated that, given the option of larger size and more weight for longer runtimes, most users would settle for what is being offered today. For better or worse, we have learned to accept the short runtime of a laptop.The energy density of modern batteries improves by about 10% per year. However, the benefit of better battery performance is eaten up by higher power requirements of laptops. This results in the same runtime but more powerful laptops.\nDuring the last few years, batteries have improved in terms of energy density. But any benefit in better battery performance is being eaten up by the higher power requirements of the laptops. This trend is continuing and the net effect will be the same runtimes but more powerful laptops.Most laptops are powered by lithium-ion. This chemistry has a high energy density and is lightweight. There is no immediate breakthrough on the horizon of a miracle battery that would provide more power than the current electro-chemical battery.Fuel cells, when available, will offer a continued stream of power by allowing the exchange of fuel cartridges when empty. Unfortunately, commercial fuel cells for laptops and other portable devices are still several years away. Power handling, size and cost remain the biggest hurdles. The early fuel cells will function more like a portable charger than a battery replacement. The fuel cells currently in use have the difficulty in providing spontaneous high power on demand. The runtime of a laptop battery is based on the activity of the computer. The basic housekeeping, which the computer needs to stay alive, draws less power than, for example, reading, writing, computations and searching for files. Manufacturers prefer using idle time when specifying runtime. A battery in a laptop ages more quickly than in other applications because of heat. During use, the inside temperature of a laptop rises to 45°C (113°F). The combination of high temperature and full state-of-charge promotes cell oxidation, a condition that cannot be reversedonce present. The battery's life expectancy when operating at high temperature is half compared to running at a more moderate 20°C (68°F) or lower. Leaving the laptop in a parked car under the hot sun will also aggravate the situation. All batteries suffer permanent capacity loss as part of elevated temperatures but lithium-ion is affected more than other batteries. Some Japanese computer manufacturers have introduced a number of sub-notebooks in which the battery is mounted externally, forming part of the housing. This design improves battery life because the battery is kept at room temperature. Some models carry several different battery sizes to accommodate a range of user demands.Lithium-ion is well suited for laptop users who continually switch from fixed power to battery use. This user pattern is typical for those in the sales, service and medical field. Here is the reason why:With nickel-based batteries, the charger applies a full charge each time the portable device is connected to fixed power. The battery is put on charge until a signal is received indicating that the battery is full. This signal is in form of a voltage change or rising temperature. Because of the sluggish response, permanent capacity loss occurs caused by overcharge and elevated temperature. Lithium-ion only receives charge if the voltage is low.\nMost laptop batteries are 'smart'; meaning that they know how much energy is left. Such a feature has definite benefits but the readings are often inaccurate. A laptop may indicate 30 minutes of remaining runtime when suddenly the screen goes dark. Here is the reason why:With use and time, a tracking error occurs between the chemical battery and the digital sensing circuit. The most ideal use of the 'smart' battery, as far as fuel-gauge accuracy is concerned, is a full charge followed by a full discharge at a constant current. In such a case, the tracking error would be less than 1% per cycle. In real life, however, a battery may be discharged for only a few minutes and the load may vary widely. Long storage also contributes to errors because the circuit cannot accurately compensate for self-discharge. Eventually, the true capacity of the battery no longer synchronizes with the fuel gauge and a full charge and deliberate full discharge will be needed to 're-learn' or calibrate the battery. There are no standards to tell what constitutes a fully charged and fully discharged battery. Lithium-ion packs are considered fully charged when the limiting voltage (4.20V/cell) is reached and the saturation current has decreased to 3% of the nominal value (50mA on a 1700mAh cell). Some chargers use 5% and 8% as 'ready' criteria.) A full discharge occurs when the cell reaches 3V/cell or lower. At this voltage level, the battery has a remaining capacity of 3 to 10%. Modern batteries adjust to a lower cut-off voltage on high load currents and include temperature compensation. To calibrate a battery, a full charge and discharge is necessary. One without the other does not constitute a calibration. A problem arises if the battery is recharged after a brief use without providing the opportunity of a full discharge. A forced discharge to \"Low Battery\" may be needed from time to time. What happens if no battery calibration is done? Can such a battery be used in confidence? Most 'smart' battery chargers obey the dictates of the chemical cells rather than that of the electronic circuit. In this case, the battery will fully charge regardless of the fuel gauge setting and function normally but the digital readout will become increasingly more inaccurate. If not corrected, the fuel gauge simply becomes a nuisance. Cadex Electronics manufactures 'smart' chargers and battery analyzers that are capable of calibrating a 'smart' battery.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "The recommended storage temperature for most batteries is 15°C (59°F); the extreme allowable temperature is –40°C to 50°C (–40°C to 122°F) for most chemistries.\nYou can store a sealed lead acid battery for up to 2 years. Since all batteries gradually self-discharge over time, it is important to check the voltage and/or specific gravity, and then apply a charge when the battery falls to 70 percent state-of-charge, which reflects 2.07V/cell open circuit or 12.42V for a 12V pack. (The specific gravity at 70 percent charge is roughly 1.218.) Lead acid batteries may have different readings, and it is best to check the manufacturer’s instruction manual. Some battery manufacturer may further let a lead acid to drop to 60 percent before recharge. See BU-903: How to Measure State-of-charge)\nLow charge induces sulfation, an oxidation layer on the negative plate that inhibits current flow. Topping charge and/or cycling may restore some of the capacity losses in the early stages of sulfation. (See BU-804b: Sulfation and How to Prevent it)\nSulfation may prevent charging small sealed lead acid cells, such as the Cyclone by Hawker, after prolonged storage. These batteries can often be reactivated by applying an elevated voltage. At first, the cell voltage under charge may go up to 5V and draw very little current. Within 2 hours or so, the charging current converts the large sulfate crystals into active material, the cell resistance drops and the charge voltage gradually normalizes. At between 2.10V and 2.40V the cell is able to accept a normal charge. To prevent damage, set the current limit to a very low level. Do not attempt to perform this service if the power supply does not have current limiting. (See BU-405: Charging with a Power Supply)\nRecommended storage is around 40 percent state-of-charge (SoC). This minimizes age-related capacity loss while keeping the battery operational and allowing for some self-discharge. Nickel-based batteries can be stored in a fully discharged state with no apparent side effect.\nMeasuring SoC by voltage is difficult on nickel-based batteries. A flat discharge curve, agitation after charge and discharge and temperature affects the voltage. The good news is that the charge level for storage is not critical for this chemistry, so simply apply some charge if the battery is empty and store it in a cool and dry place. With some charge, priming should be quicker than if stored in a totally discharged state.\nNickel-metal-hydride can be stored for 3–5 years. The capacity drop that occurs during storage is partially reversible with priming. Nickel-cadmium stores well. The US Air Force was able to deploy NiCd batteries that had been in storage for 5 years with good recovered capacities after priming. It is believed that priming becomes necessary if the voltage drops below 1V/cell. Primary alkaline and lithium batteries can be stored for up to 10 years with only moderate capacity loss.\nThere is virtually no self-discharge below about 4.0V at 20C (68F); storing at 3.7V yields amazing longevity for most Li-ion systems. Finding the exact 40–50 percent SoC level to store Li-ion is not that important. At 40 percent charge, most Li-ion has an OCV of 3.82V/cell at room temperature. To get the correct reading after a charge or discharge, rest the battery for 90 minutes before taking the reading. If this is not practical, overshoot the discharge voltage by 50mV or go 50mV higher on charge. This means discharging to 3.77V/cell or charging to 3.87V/cell at a C-rate of 1C or less. The rubber band effect will settle the voltage at roughly 3.82V. Figure 1 shows the typical discharge voltage of a Li-ion battery.\nBattery SoC is reflected in OCV. Lithium manganese oxide reads 3.82V at 40% SoC (25°C), and about 3.70V at 30% (shipping requirement). Temperature and previous charge and discharge activities affect the reading. Allow the battery to rest for 90 minutes before taking the reading.\nLi-ion cannot dip below 2V/cell for any length of time. Copper shunts form inside the cells that can lead to elevated self-discharge or a partial electrical short. (See BU-802b: Elevated Self-discharge) If recharged, the cells might become unstable, causing excessive heat or showing other anomalies. Li-ion batteries that have been under stress may function normally but are more sensitive to mechanical abuse. Liability for incorrect handling should go to the user and not the battery manufacturer.\nAlkaline and other primary batteries are easy to store. For best results, keep the cells at cool room temperature and at a relative humidity of about 50 percent. Do not freeze alkaline cells, or any battery, as this may change the molecular structure. Some lithium-based primary batteries need special care that is described in BU-106a: Choices of Primary Batteries.\nStorage induces two forms of losses: Self-discharge that can be refilled with charging before use, and non-recoverable losses that permanently lower the capacity. Table 2 illustrates the remaining capacities of lithium- and nickel-based batteries after one year of storage at various temperatures. Li-ion has higher losses if stored fully charged rather than at a SoC of 40 percent. (See BU-808: How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries to study capacity loss in Li-ion.)\nBatteries are often exposed to unfavorable temperatures, and leaving a mobile phone or camera on the dashboard of a car or in the hot sun are such examples. Laptops get warm when in use and this increases the battery temperature. Sitting at full charge while plugged into the mains shortens battery life. Elevated temperature also stresses lead- and nickel-based batteries. (See BU-808: How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries)\nNickel-metal-hydride can be stored for 3–5 years. The capacity drop that occurs during storage is partially reversible with priming. Nickel-cadmium stores well.

For best results, keep the cells at cool room temperature and at a relative humidity of about 50 percent. Do not freeze alkaline cells, or any battery, as this may change the molecular structure.\nLi-ion batteries not only live longer when stored partially charged; they are also less volatile in shipment should an anomaly occur. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and FAA mandate that all removable Li-ion packs be shipped at 30% state-of-charge. (More on BU-704a: Shipping Lithium-based Batteries by Air) SoC can be estimated by measuring the open circuit voltage of a rested battery. (See also BU-903: How to Measure State-of-charge)\nRelating SoC to voltage can be inaccurate as the voltage curve of Li-ion between 20% to 100% charge is flat, as Figure 1 demonstrates. Temperature also plays a role, so do the active materials used in a cell. Aviation authorities seem less concerned about the exact 30% SoC but the importance of shipping Li-ion below 50% SoC. Larger misgivings are wrong labeling by passing Li-ion as a benign nickel-based chemistry.\nTo bring Li-ion to 30% SoC, discharge the battery in a device featuring a fuel gauge and terminate the discharge at 30% charge. The Embedded Battery Management System (BMS) does a reasonably good job giving SoC information but the measurements are seldom accurate. A full discharge to “Low Batt” is acceptable as long as the battery receives a charge at destination. Keeping Li-ion in a discharged state for a few months could slip the pack to sleep mode. (See BU-808a: How to Awaken a Sleeping Li-ion)\nModern chargers feature the “AirShip” program that prepares a Li-ion pack for air shipment by discharging or charging the battery to 30% SoC on command. Typical methods are a full discharge with subsequent recharge to 30% using coulomb counting or advanced Kalman filters. Li-ion batteries built into devices have less stringent SoC requirements than removable packs.\nWear approved gloves when touching electrolyte, lead and cadmium. On exposure to skin, flush with water immediately.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "Even though smart batteries have been in service since the mid-1990s, they still behave much like a “black box” and do not communicate to the outside world. Device manufacturers continue to mandate that the battery be replaced on a date stamp rather than refer to the more relevant FCC information contained in the battery. Expensive packs are thus discarded every 2–3 years instead of utilizing the full 5-year life expectancy of Li-ion.\nA new frontier is opening that provides easy battery information. The Battery Parser (by Cadex) does this by establishing communications between the user and the battery by fetching intrinsic battery data to reveal state-of-function (SoF). The Fishbowl icon as shown in Figure 1 consists of the Charge Ring indicating state-of-charge and the Status Dome with PASS, CHARGE, CHECK, and FAIL messages. The Status Dome also illustrates the energy storage capability together with Battery Fade that moves towards the Pass/Fail line with usage and age.\nPASS indicates sufficient capacity and SoC CHARGE requires charging before use as SoC slipped below the Charge Alarm. CHECK includes cell imbalance, high Max Error, elevated internal resistance and more. FAIL hints at capacity fade, exceeding calendar date or passing beyond pre-set cycle count.\nBattery status indicators must separate state-of-charge and capacity and treat them as unrelated entities. While a battery with low SoC can be recharged, capacity loss is permanent and predicts end-of-life. This condition is demonstrated with the encroaching black ceiling bar on top of the Fishbowl. Pressing the Status Dome on a device featuring a touchscreen reveals possible deficiencies, as well as information relating to the battery model, specifications, serial number and manufacturing date. The Fishbowl settings can be altered by the user.\nStoring the battery test results in a cloud-based database enables an overview of the entire battery fleet in terms of location, application, performance and service requirements. This is made possible with the availability of the serial number and manufacturing date in a smart battery. To check batteries needing replacement, the operator simply calls up packs that have dropped below the 80 percent capacity or are older than, say, 5 years.\nThe operator can also verify SoC by listing all batteries with less than 10 percent reserve before charging. Tight reserve could lead to failure during heavy traffic or in an emergency. If consistently low, the pass/fail target capacity threshold should be set higher to boost the reserve. If, on the other hand, most batteries return with 40 percent capacity after a long mission or a full day, then the target capacity can be lowered without affecting reliability.\nThe Battery Parser finds a sweet spot between reliability and economy. The service life of each battery can be fully utilized and system reliability improved, reducing environmental harm and lowering operating costs. In addition, fewer devices are sent for repair because the battery becomes a controlled part.\nA cost saving by using battery analysis was demonstrated in a 340-bed hospital in the USA. When the need to replace the batteries for patient monitors came to $56,000 on the date stamp method, the supervisor objected and requested that the packs be checked with a battery analyzer. This revealed that most batteries were in good condition and the budget was reduced to $11,000.\nMilitary is another application where battery analysis will help. A modern soldier carries radios, GPS devices, smartphones, night vision goggles, infrared sights, flashlights and counter-IED equipment. This amounts to roughly seven battery types, of which 10 packs are needed each for a 72-hour mission at a weight of about 9kg (20 lb) per solider. Batteries have become the second highest expense next to munitions. This can be reduced with a maintenance program, without which soldiers are soon carrying rocks instead of batteries as Figure 2 demonstrates.\nMaintenance keeps deadwood out of the military arsenal. The digital state-of-health of “smart” batteries can be verified within seconds or recorded during each charge.\nOther uses for the Battery Parser are drones and robots. Drones are demanding on the battery as heavy loads result in a shorter than expected cycle life. Battery maintenance is paramount to prevent an expensive vehicle from crashing should a second landing approach be necessary. (See also BU-504: How to Verify Sufficient Battery Capacity)\nBattery maintenance utilizing the Battery Parser is best placed into the battery charger. Such a system shows the capacity with each charge. Alternatively, a quick insertion reveals the battery status before use. Knowing the performance of each battery enables planning a mission according to the available energy source, reducing unscheduled events.\nWireless connectivity to the cloud permits collective battery management in which each charge updates the information. This provides one of the most transparent battery management systems possible without added logistics. Battery status can be shown on a PC or smartphone with the click of a finger.\nSmart batteries and chargers with performance evaluation further assist to classify batteries into performance groups: A-grade batteries with a capacity of 90–100 percent can be reserved for critical missions, B-grade packs with 80–90 percent are for everyday use, and the C-grade with 70–80 percent may be kept as spares or used for shorter errands. Having full control of the battery fleet improves reliability, simplifies logistics and protects the environment as each battery can be utilized for their full service life.\n[1] Courtesy: Cadex Electronics\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "content": "The energy a battery holds can be measured with a battery analyzer by applying a full discharge. The battery is first charged and then discharged at a controlled current while measuring the time to reach the end-of-discharge point(See BU-402: What is the C-rate?) A capacity of 100 percent delivers the specified Ah; 50 percent is shown if the discharge time is cut in half.\nMeasuring capacity by discharge gives the most reliable assessment, a method that is most effective with portable batteries. A periodic analysis ensures that the batteries are kept within an acceptable performance range and prompts replacement if the capacity is below a required target threshold and can no longer be raised. Larger batteries are normally not cycled as this is time-consuming and stresses the battery. That’s where non-invasive test methods come in(See BU-904: How to Measure Capacity)\nProgress is being made with rapid-testing but this only provides estimated state-of-health results and the accuracies vary with the technology used. While older rapid-test methods measured the internal battery resistance, advanced rapid-test methods look at diffusion, charge transfer and migration that are present in Li-ion and lead acid batteries(See BU-907: Testing Lithium-based Batteries)\nTechnicians are most comfortable testing a battery with a voltmeter, anything further goes beyond the routine for many. Chemistry, voltage and Ah markings on the battery are often not well understood, nor are maintenance folks sure what to look for in a battery. Many portable packs have multiple connections with unclear markings. Hesitation is understandable as batteries come in many chemistries and vary in size from a coin to installations filling an entire building. A voltage reading gives instant results by showing that something is alive and a brief loading verifies power, but this does not assure sustained delivery that is so critical in a battery.\nBattery analyzers became popular in the 1980s and 1990s to restore nickel-cadmium batteries that were affected by “memory.” Today these workhorses are used to analyze a broad range of batteries as part of fleet management and assuring system integrity. Periodic battery analysis is needed because batteries tend to have a shorter life than the host it powers. Battery analyzers act as gatekeepers to retire packs when they fall below a set performance criteria.\nFigure 1 illustrates a Cadex C7x00 C-Series battery analyzer that accommodates lead-, nickel- and lithium-based batteries. The instrument features automated service programs and operates in stand-alone mode or with PC software.\nFour-station analyzers services batteries from 1.2 to 36V and 6A charge and discharge currents. The batteries interface with custom Battery Adapters that configure the analyzer to the correct setting.\nThe most common program is Auto that charges a battery, applies a discharge to measure capacity and completes the program with a final charge. Other programs include Custom to put the battery through a unique choice of charge, discharge, wait and repeat. The Lifecycle program cycles the battery until the capacity has dropped to the preset target capacity while counting the cycles. This program is used to evaluate battery durability. OhmTest measures the internal battery resistance and Runtime discharges a battery at three different current levels to simulate unique usage pattern. QuickSort™ sorts lithium-ion batteries into Good, Low and Poor in 30 seconds, and Boost reactivates packs that have fallen asleep due to over-discharge. Further programs include Self-Discharge to test losses and Prime that cycles a battery until the maximum capacity is reached. Prime also verifies the spare capacity before charge.\nConnecting various shapes of batteries to an analyzer has always been a challenge and folks have designed fancy contraptions with springs and levers so complicated that only the inventor can operate. There are no simple ways to connect a battery, especially when servicing small packs with tiny surface contacts or smart batteries with numerous blade contacts.\nCadex solved the battery interface with SnapLock™ adapters. These custom-made adapters are easy to use as they are designed for a given battery type; they only go in one way. Each adapter stores up to 10 codes (C-codes) that configures the analyzer to the correct settings. The user can edit the parameters with the analyzer’s menu function or with the PC-BatteryShop™ software. The universal adapters interface to specialty packs, such as mobile phone batteries; larger batteries connect by the user-programmable Smart Cable.\nA battery analyzer would not be complete without intuitive software. PC-BatteryShop™ provides a simple yet powerful PC-interface to control and monitor Cadex C7x00 C-Series Battery Analyzers. With software, the PC becomes the command center and displays charge and discharge characteristics in real time. Clicking the mouse on any of the 3,000 batteries listed in the database or swiping the bar code on the battery label configures the analyzer. Figure 2 demonstrates such a system.\nRunning on software, the PC takes over the control of the battery analyzer. Programming is by clicking on a battery in the database or scanning the battery label.\nSmart batteries enable a new level of battery analysis by reading the battery serial number, model, type and age, as well as the digital equivalent of the capacity that reflects battery state-of-health without applying a full discharge. A full discharge will still be needed occasionally to verify and calibrate the battery(See BU-604: How to Process Data from a “Smart” Battery)\nWhile battery analyzers check batteries in service and predict replacement, battery test systems provide multi-purpose test functions for research laboratories. Typical applications are life-cycle testing to simulate battery loading and verifying durability in the field, as well as checking cell balance of a multi-cell pack in field simulation. These tests can be fully automated with a custom program that the user composes.\nFigure 3 illustrates the Cadex C8000, a battery test system that captures load signatures of mobile phones, laptops and power tools, and then applies the simulated loads to verify battery runtime as if used in real life situations. The device is capable of monitoring individual cells with the help of floating analog inputs. The Dual Power Port Cable extends the discharge current from 10A per station to 20A by parallel function. Higher wattage is possible by connecting the C8000 to an external load bank. The system also manages environmental chambers and reads SMBus batteries while being in full control of all functions from one central point.\nFour independent channels provide up to 10A each and 36V nominal. Maximum charge power is 400W, discharge is 320W. The discharge power can be enhanced with external load banks.\nBeing digital provides advantages over analog by offering a large test range in a compact housing. This eliminates the need to buy extra modules to perform low and high voltage and current measurements. Another advantage is ultimate immunity from neighboring channels. The limitation is the inability to measure extremely low voltage and current that would be possible with specialty modules. The C8000 works as a stand-alone or with PC-BatteryLab™ operating up to eight C8000 analyzers servicing 32 batteries independently (with most PCs).\nA battery test system, such as the Cadex C8000, includes many redundant safety algorithms that identify a faulty battery and terminate a service before an unwanted event could occur. Such security may not be available when using a programmable power supply and a programmable load to test batteries. Although an open platform offers great flexibility, it requires careful programming to prevent stress to the battery inflicting possible damage or fire if an anomaly occurs. For destructive tests the safeguards of the C8000 can be overridden.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "BU-902: How to Measure Internal Resistance",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-902-how-to-measure-internal-resistance",
        "content": "The internal resistance provides valuable information about a battery as high reading hints at end-of-life. This is especially true with nickel-based systems. Resistance measurement is not the only performance indicator as the value between batches of lead acid batteries can vary by 5–10 percent, especially with stationary units. Because of this wide tolerance, the resistance method works best when comparing the readings of a given battery from birth to retirement. Service crews are asked to take a snapshot of each cell or monoblock at time of installation and then measure the subtle changes as the cells age.\nThere is a notion that internal resistance is related to capacity, but this is false. The resistance of modern lead acid and lithium-ion batteries stays flat through most of the service life. Better electrolyte additives have reduced internal corrosion issues that affect the resistance. This corrosion is also known as parasitic reactions on the electrolyte and electrodes. Figure 1 shows capacity fade with cycling in relation to the internal resistance of Li-ion cells.\nResistance does not reveal the state-of-health of a battery and often stays flat with use and aging.\nCycle test on Li-ion batteries at 1C:\nBefore exploring the different methods of measuring the internal resistance of a battery, let’s examine what electrical resistance means and understand the difference between pure resistance (R) and impedance (Z). R is pure resistance and Z includes reactive elements such as coils and capacitors. Both readings are obtained in ohms (‎Ω), a measurement that goes back to the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm, who lived from 1798 to 1854. (One ohm produces a voltage drop of 1V with a current of 1A.) The electric conductivity is also measured in siemens (s) that is reciprocal to ohmic values.\nThe electrical resistance of a pure load, such as a heating element, has no reactance. Voltage and current flow in unison and there is no advancing or trailing phase. The ohmic resistance is the same with direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). The power factor (pf) is 1, providing the most accurate metering of the power consumed.\nMost electrical loads are reactive and consist of capacitive reactance (capacitor) and inductive reactance (coil). The capacitive reactance decreases with higher frequency while the inductive reactance increases. An analogy of inductive reactance is an oil damper that stiffens when applying a fast back-and-forth action.\nA battery has resistance, capacitance and inductance, and the term impedance includes all three in one model. Impedance can best be illustrated with the Randles model (Figure 2) that comprises resistors R1 and R2 as well as capacitor C. The inductive reactance is commonly omitted because it plays a negligible role in a battery, especially at a low frequency.\nThe overall battery resistance consists of ohmic resistance, as well as inductive and capacitive reactance. The diagram and electrical values differ for every battery.\nMeasuring the battery by resistance is almost as old as the battery itself and several methods have developed over time, all of which are still in use.\nThe ohmic measurement is one of the oldest and most reliable test methods. The battery receives a brief discharge for a second or longer. The load current for a small battery is 1A or less; for a starter battery it might be 50A or more. A voltmeter measures the open circuit voltage (OCV) with no load, followed by the second reading with a load; Ohm’s law calculates the resistance value (voltage difference divided by current equals resistance).\nDC load measurements work well to check large stationary batteries, and the ohmic readings of the device are very accurate and repeatable. High-end test instruments claim resistance readings in the 10 micro-ohm range. Many garages use the carbon pile to measure starter batteries and an experienced mechanic gets a reasonably good assessment of the battery.\nThe DC load method has limitations in that it blends R1 and R2 of the Randles model into one combined resistor and ignores the capacitor (see Figure 3). “C” is an important component of a battery that represents 1.5 farads per 100Ah capacity. In essence, the DC method sees the battery as a resistor and can only provide ohmic references. In addition, the DC load method gets similar readings from a good battery that is partially charged and a marginal battery that is fully charged. State-of-charge and capacity estimations are not possible.\nThe two-tier DC load method offers an alternative method by applying two sequential discharge loads of different currents and time durations. The battery first discharges at a low current for 10 seconds, followed by a higher current for 3 seconds (see Figure 4); the Ohm’s law calculates the resistance values. Evaluating the voltage signature under the two load conditions offers additional information about the battery, but the values are strictly resistive and do not reveal SoC or capacity estimations. The load test is the preferred method for batteries that power DC loads.\nThe two-tier DC load follows the IEC 61951-1:2005 standards and provides lifelike test conditions for many DC battery applications.\nConductance measurement to evaluate starter batteries was first reported by Keith Champlin in 1975 by demonstrating a linear correlation between load test and conductance. When injecting a frequency of about 90 hertz, capacitive and inductive reactance converge with a 70–90Ah lead acid battery, resulting in a negligible voltage lag that minimizes the reactance. (This frequency rises with a smaller battery and drops with a large pack.) AC conductance meters are commonly used in car garages to measure CCA. The single-frequency method (Figure 5) sees the components of the Randles model as one complex impedance called the modulus of Z.\nThe individual components of the Randles model are molten together and cannot be distinguished.\nThe 1,000-hertz (Hz) ohm test is another common method. A 1,000Hz signal excites the battery and Ohm’s law calculates the resistance. Note that the AC method shows different values to the DC method when measuring a reactive resistance, and both readings are correct.\nFor example, Li-ion in an 18650 cell produces about 36mOhm with a 1,000Hz AC signal and roughly 110mOhm with a DC load. Since both readings are valid, yet far apart, the user must consider the application. The pulse DC load method provides valuable readings for a DC application such as a heating element or an incandescent light, while the 1,000Hz method better reflects the performance requirements of a digital load, such as portable computing and mobile phones that rely to a large extent on the capacitive characteristics of a battery. Figure illustrates the 1,000Hz-method. (See also Table 2 in BU-802a: How does Rising Internal Resistance affect Performance?)\nThe 1000-hertz provides reactive resistance readings. This has been the preferred method for taking impedance snapshots of batteries powering digital devices.\nResearch laboratories have been using EIS for many years to evaluate battery characteristics. High equipment cost, slow test times and the need for trained professionals to decipher the large volume of data have limited this technology to laboratory environments. EIS reads R1, R2 and C values in the Randles model (Figure 7); however, correlating the data into CCA and capacity estimations requires complex modeling(See BU-904: How to Measure Capacity)\nR1, R2 and C are measured separately, which enables state-of-charge and capacity measurements.\n[1] Courtesy of Cadex\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.

        "title": "Battery Fuel Gauge: Factual or Fallacy?",
        "url": "https://batteryuniversity.com/article/battery-fuel-gauge-factual-or-fallacy",
        "content": "Many perceive a battery as being an energy storage device that is similar to a fuel tank dispensing liquid fuel. For simplicity, a battery can be seen as such; however, measuring stored energy from an electrochemical device is far more complex. The process is fraught with confusion, is poorly understood, and this article describes the challenges of measuring energy from a battery.\nBefore looking into the fuel gauge concept deeper, we assume that state-of-charge (SoC) is the relative stored energy in a battery that can be released under prevailing conditions. The prevailing conditions are mostly unknown to the battery user, and besides SoC they include the actual battery capacity, load currents and operating temperature. State-of-function (SoF), the all-encompassing criteria that includes SoC, capacity and delivery, is difficult to measure and remains mostly guesswork. Considering these limitations, one can appreciate why most battery fuel gauges are inaccurate.\nUnlike a fuel tank that has a known volumetric dimension, the fuel gauge of a battery has unconfirmed definitions. Other than the open circuit voltage (OCV), which only approximates SoC, a battery does not have fundamental internal parameters that relate to SoC. The Ah rating, which the manufacturer specifies, only applies for the short time when the battery is new. In essence, a battery is a shrinking vessel that takes less energy with each subsequent charge, and the stated Ah rating is only a reference of what the battery should be holding. The battery is not an energy container per se that guarantees a given amount of energy under all conditions but exhibits a human quality delivering on prevailing situations.\nA common error in fuel gauge design is ignoring the aging aspect by assuming that the battery will stay perfect. Such oversight will limit the service to about two years before the readings become inaccurate. The scaling of most fuel gauges is analogous to liquid fuel: full charge indicates 100% and empty is zero percent. Zero is the point when the battery reaches the low voltage knee at the end of discharge.\nDischarging a battery rated at 1Ah should provide a current of 1A for one hour. This only holds true while the battery is new and discharged at room temperature. If the capacity shrinks to 50%, the fuel gauge of a fully charged battery will still show 100% but the expected one-hour runtime is reduced to 30 minutes. Running the battery below freezing reduces the time further. For the casual cellphone or laptop user, this error only causes inconvenience; however, the problem becomes more evident with electric vehicles and other critical battery operated devices that depend on the remaining runtime to reach the destination.\nModern fuel gauges adapt to prevailing conditions by “learning” how much energy the battery was able to deliver on the previous discharge. Learning, or trending, may also include charge time because a faded battery charges quicker than a good one. It is also common to measure the internal battery resistance by observing the voltage drop; however, capacity estimation based on raising resistance no longer works well because the modern Li-ion maintains low resistance through most of its service life.\nCapacity is best measured by discharging a fully charged battery at a constant current and reading the elapsed time. Most rechargeable batteries for portable use are specified at 1C discharge. A battery rated at 1Ah would therefore discharge at 1A. The rated discharge of primary cells, such as alkaline, is much lower. Measuring battery capacity by discharge/charge is impractical and stresses the battery.\nThe fuel gauge has the inherent drawback of needing periodic calibration, also known as capacity re-learning. This is done to correct the tracking error that develops between the chemical and digital battery on repeated charge and discharge cycles. Calibration could be omitted if the battery received a periodic full discharge at constant current followed by a full charge. The battery would reset with each full cycle and the tracking error would be kept at less than one percent per cycle. In real life, however, a battery may be discharged for a few minutes with a load signature that is difficult to capture, then partially recharged and stored with varying levels of self-discharge depending temperature and age.\nManual calibration is possible by running the battery down until “Low Battery” appears. This can be done in the equipment or with a battery analyzer. A full discharge sets the discharge flag and the subsequent recharge the charge flag. Establishing these two markers allows SoC to be calculated by tracking the distance between the flags. For best results, calibrate a device in continuous use every three months or after 40 partial cycles. If the device applies a periodic deep discharge on its own accord, no additional calibration will be required. Figure 1 shows the full-discharge and full-charge flags.\nFigure 1: Full-discharge and full-charge flags set calibration\nCalibration occurs by applying a full charge, discharge and charge. This can be done in the equipment or with a battery analyzer as part of battery maintenance.\nCourtesy Cadex\nWhat happens if the battery is not calibrated regularly? Can such a battery be used with confidence? Most smart battery chargers obey the dictates of the chemical battery rather than the electronic circuit and there are no safety concerns if out of calibration. The battery will charge fully and function normally but the digital readout may be inaccurate and become a nuisance.\nMeasuring state-of-charge by voltage is simple but it can be inaccurate and here is why. Batteries within a given chemistry have dissimilar architectures and deliver unique voltage profiles. Temperature also plays a role; heat raises the voltage, a cold ambient lowers it. This phenomenon applies to all chemistries in varying degrees. Furthermore, when disturbing the battery with a charge or discharge, the open circuit voltage no longer represents the true SoC reading and the battery will require a few hours of rest to regain equilibrium; battery manufacturers recommend 24 hours. While lead acid batteries have a gradual voltage drop on discharge, nickel- and lithium-based batteries tend to be flat and SoC estimation by voltage is difficult. Consumer products using the voltage-based fuel gauges limit the readout to show full charge, mid-range and low charge.\nA more advanced method to measure SoC is coulomb counting. The theory that goes back 250 years when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb first established the “Coulomb Rule.” It works on the principle of measuring in and out flowing currents. Figure 2 illustrates the principle graphically.\nFigure 2: Principle of a fuel gauge based on coulomb counting\nThe stored energy represents state-of-charge; a circuit measures the in-and-out flowing current.\nCourtesy of Cadex\nCoulomb counting experiences errors as well. For example, if a battery was charged for one hour at one ampere, the same amount of energy should be available on discharge. This is not the case. Inefficiencies in charge acceptance, especially towards the end of charge, as well as losses during discharge and storage reduce the total energy delivered and skew the readings. The available energy is always less than what had been fed into the battery. For example, the energy cycle (charging and then discharging) of the Li-ion batteries in the Tesla Roadster is about 86% efficient.\nAs with any numeric integration technique, coulomb counting accumulates error over time, which the modern fuel gauge tries to correct using voltage curves. Since these voltage curves harbor inaccuracies themselves, especially as the battery ages, the accuracy will continue to degrade over time.\nThe Adaptive System on Diffusion (ASOD) by Cadex features a unique “Learn” function that adjusts to battery aging and achieves a capacity estimation of +/-2% across 1,000 battery cycles, the typical life span of a battery. The SoC estimation is within +/-5%, independent of age and polarization. ASOD does not require outside parameters; it is self-learning. When replacing the battery, the learned matrix will gradually adapt to the new battery through use and achieve the previous high accuracy again.\nResearchers are exploring new methods to measure battery SoC, and such an innovative technology is quantum magnetism (Q-Mag™). Q-Mag by Cadex does not rely on voltage or current flow but it looks at magnetism. The negative plate on a discharging lead acid battery changes from lead to lead sulfate, which has a different magnetic susceptibility than lead. A sensor based on a quantum mechanical process reads the magnetic field through a process called tunneling. Figure 3 compares the magnetic field response of a fully charged battery to one that is 20% charged. A low battery has a three-fold increase in magnetic susceptibility compared to one that is fully charged.\nFigure 3: SoC by magnetic field response\nThe permeability of the plates increases by a factor of 3 from full charge to empty. TMR is Tunneling Magneto Resistance, also known as magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ)\nIt is conceivable that a new technology has been found that can measure battery SoC with an accuracy that was not imaginable before. Knowing the precise intrinsic SoC enables improved chargers but more importantly, the technology provides battery diagnostics, including capacity estimation and end-of-life prediction. The immediate benefit, however, lies in building a better and more accurate fuel gauge.\nLi-ion, including lithium iron phosphate, has a very flat discharge curve. Figure 4 shows a linear drop of the relative magnetic field units on discharge and a corresponding raise on charge when monitored with Q-Mag. There is no rubber-band effect associated with the voltage method in which discharge lowers the voltage and charge raises it. Q-Mag takes readings while the battery is being charged or is under load. The SoC accuracy with Li-ion is +/-5%, lead acid is +/-7%; calibration occurs by applying a full charge. The excitation current is less than 1mA, and the system is immune to most interference. Q-Mag works with cells encased in foil, aluminum, stainless steel, but not ferrous metals. The tests are conducted in the laboratories of Cadex Electronics Inc.\nFigure 4: Magnetic field measurements of a lithium iron phosphate during charge and discharge.\nRelative magnetic field units provide accurate state-of-charge of lithium- and lead-based batteries.\nSoC measurements consist of several readings, and the most common ones are voltage, current and coulomb counting. While the accuracy of these systems is good enough for consumer products where a false indication only causes mild annoyance, medical and military devices, as well as the electric vehicle demand more. A stranded motorist with a mistaken empty battery would attract more media attention than a dropped call of a dead cell phone or a computer screen going dark too soon.\nAlthough noticeable improvements have been made in SoC accuracies, further advances are needed and innovative new technologies are promising. They will not only provide better SoC accuracies but offer state-of-health and end-of-life prediction. Scientists predict that these developments will be available at competitive prices. With these forward-looking technologies in mind, the modern battery fuel gauge will no longer remain a fallacy but become factual.\nComments are intended for \"commenting,\" an open discussion amongst site visitors.
